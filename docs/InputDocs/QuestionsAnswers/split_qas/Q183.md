### 183) Do we need special contracts with cloud providers beyond their standard terms?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Supplier relationship (ISO27001 A.15.1.1):** ensures vendors meet security requirements.  
- **Processor contract (GDPR Art.28):** mandatory terms for data processors.

**Plain-English answer**  
Yes—embed addenda covering data-protection clauses (e.g., SCCs), audit rights, sub-processor authorizations, SLAs for availability, and breach notification. Your standard cloud contract rarely includes all required controls.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.15.1.1; GDPR Article 28

**Why it matters**  
Provides legal footing for audits, liabilities, and regulatory obligations.

**Do next in our platform**  
1. Open **Contract Clauses Library**.  
2. Run **Contract Review** workflow to append missing clauses.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Draft Doc]** Clause-by-clause contract generator.  
- **[Workflow]** Legal-review routing and e-signature.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Which clauses address data-residency?  
- How to handle multi-region provider changes?
