## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of equipment security like managing a fleet of armored vehicles transporting valuable cargo through hostile territory.** Just as each vehicle requires specific protective measures (armor plating, secure locks, GPS tracking, communication systems), route planning (avoiding high-risk areas, coordinated movements, secure parking), maintenance protocols (regular inspections, secure service facilities, verified technicians), and incident response capabilities (emergency communications, rapid response teams, secure recovery procedures), organizational IT equipment requires comprehensive protection throughout its lifecycle and operational environment.

Equipment Security provides **comprehensive asset protection** for all computing and information processing equipment, ensuring physical and logical security from acquisition through secure disposal, regardless of location or operational context.

## 2. Procedure Overview

This Equipment Security Procedure establishes systematic controls for protecting information processing equipment from physical and environmental threats, unauthorized access, theft, and damage. The procedure covers equipment placement, protection, maintenance, transportation, and disposal to ensure comprehensive security throughout the equipment lifecycle.
