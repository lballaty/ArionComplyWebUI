### 245) How do we handle ongoing monitoring or oversight from regulators?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Review (NIS2 Art.29):** Member States must monitor essential entities.  
- **Monitoring & measurement (ISO 27001 Cl.9.1):** internal performance checks.

**Plain-English answer**  
Maintain a **Regulatory Oversight Calendar** with scheduled check-ins, data submissions, and audit dates. Assign owners for each event, prepare evidence packs in advance, and use automated reminders.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** NIS2 Article 29; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 9.1  
- **Also relevant:** GDPR audit rights

**Why it matters**  
Staying ahead of oversight avoids last-minute scrambles and potential non-compliance.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Populate **Reg Monitoring** register with known events.  
- Set up **Oversight Response** workflows for upcoming reviews.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Tracker]** Calendar view with countdown timers.  
- **[Reminder]** Alerts and evidence-pack auto-generation.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Can we delegate evidence gathering to specific teams?
