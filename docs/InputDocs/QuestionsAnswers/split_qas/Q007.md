### 7) Are these compliance things optional or will I get in legal trouble if I ignore them?

**Standard terms)**
- **Regulation (GDPR Article 83; CPRA §1798.155; NIS2 Articles 34–36):** mandatory legal requirements with enforcement powers.
- **Standard (ISO 27001, 27701):** voluntary frameworks you can certify against.

**Plain-English answer**
Standards are **optional**—they’re best practices you can certify to. Regulations are **law**—if you’re in scope, non-compliance can lead to **fines**, **orders**, or **other sanctions**. Ignoring laws like GDPR, CPRA, or NIS2 can get you in legal trouble; ignoring ISO standards may hurt sales **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 83; NIS2 Articles 34–36
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** CPRA Section 1798.155

**Why it matters**
Distinguish what you **must** do (laws) versus what you **should** do (standards) to allocate resources properly.

**Do next in our platform**
- Map your **mandatory duties** in the legal obligations register.
- Prioritize **legal requirements** over voluntary certifications.
- Build a **priority plan** for high-risk legal gaps.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Law vs standard matrix.
- **[Workflow]** Priority plan builder.
- **[Dashboard]** Compliance risk/penalty heatmap.
- **[Report]** Export enforcement-risk summaries.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What are our expected fines/exposure?” (**[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Do we need to certify to ISO to satisfy laws?” (No—laws stand alone, but ISO helps with evidence.)
