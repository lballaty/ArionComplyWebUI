### 5) What's the difference between ISO 27001 and ISO 27002?

**Standard terms)**  
- **ISO 27001:** management system requirements and certification standard.  
- **ISO 27002:** code of practice providing implementation guidance for controls.

**Plain-English answer**  
ISO 27001 defines WHAT you must do (management system structure, processes, documentation requirements). ISO 27002 provides HOW to implement specific security controls. Think of 27001 as the framework and 27002 as the detailed implementation guide.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 1; ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Clause 1

**Why it matters**  
Understanding the relationship helps you use both standards effectively—27001 for structure, 27002 for detailed control guidance.

**Do next in our platform**

### 6) What are the main phases of ISO 27001 implementation?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA):** continuous improvement methodology underlying ISO 27001 structure.

**Plain-English answer**  
Five main phases: 1) **Planning** (scope, risk assessment, SoA), 2) **Implementation** (controls, policies, procedures), 3) **Operation** (running the ISMS), 4) **Monitoring** (audits, reviews, metrics), 5) **Improvement** (corrective actions, updates). Each phase has specific deliverables and success criteria.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 4-10

**Why it matters**  
Structured phases ensure systematic implementation and prevent overlooking critical elements.

}
```
---
### 7) How do we determine the scope of our ISMS?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Scope (Cl. 4.3):** boundaries and applicability of the ISMS within the organization.

**Plain-English answer**  
Define what's IN scope (business processes, locations, systems, data types) and what's OUT. Consider business drivers, stakeholder requirements, regulatory needs, and practical management boundaries. Start conservative—easier to expand scope later than contract it.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3

**Why it matters**  
Clear scope prevents audit findings and ensures focused, manageable implementation.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Run **Scope Definition** workshop with stakeholders.  
- Document decisions in **Scope Boundaries** register.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workshop]** Facilitated scope definition sessions with templates.  
- **[Register]** Structured scope documentation and rationale tracking.  
- **[Draft Doc]** Auto-generation of scope statement for audit.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- "Can we exclude certain locations?" (Yes, with justification)

  "notes": "Must include all Annex A controls with inclusion/exclusion justifications"
}
```
---
### 8) What's a Statement of Applicability and how do we create it?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Statement of Applicability (SoA) (Cl. 6.1.3):** documented statement describing control objectives and controls that are relevant and applicable to the organization's ISMS.

**Plain-English answer**  
The SoA is your master control document listing all 93 Annex A controls with decisions: APPLICABLE (how you implement it) or NOT APPLICABLE (why it doesn't apply to you). It's derived from your risk treatment decisions and drives your control implementation.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 6.1.3  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Clause 5

### 10) How do we conduct a risk assessment for ISO 27001?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Risk assessment (Cl. 6.1.2, 8.2):** systematic application of management policies, procedures, and practices to identify, analyze, and evaluate information security risks.

**Plain-English answer**  
Four key steps: 1) **Identify** information assets and their value, 2) **Identify** threats and vulnerabilities, 3) **Analyze** likelihood and impact of risk scenarios, 4) **Evaluate** risks against acceptance criteria. Use our guided workflow to ensure nothing is missed.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 6.1.2, 8.2  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27005:2018 Clause 7

**Why it matters**  
Risk assessment drives your entire control selection and prioritization—it's the foundation of your ISMS.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch **Risk Assessment** workflow with step-by-step guidance.  
- Populate and maintain **Risk Register** with findings.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Comprehensive risk register with automated calculations.  
- **[Workflow]** Guided risk assessment methodology with templates.  
- **[Report]** Risk dashboard and executive summaries.

**Likely follow-ups**
