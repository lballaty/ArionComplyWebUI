### 197) How often do we need to update our training materials and re-train people?

**Standard terms**  
- **Awareness & training (ISO27001 Cl.7.3):** calls for “periodic” refreshers.

**Plain-English answer**  
As a rule of thumb, **annually** for general staff and **bi-annually** for high-risk roles (e.g., DevOps, incident responders). Update sooner when new threats emerge or processes change.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.3

**Why it matters**  
Keeps knowledge current and reduces risk of outdated practices.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Use **Retraining Scheduler** to set intervals per role.  
- Review **Training Matrix** for last completion dates.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Reminder]** Automated retraining notifications.  
- **[Workflow]** Content-update and approval process.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Can retraining be self-paced?  
- How to measure training effectiveness?
