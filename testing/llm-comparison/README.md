# ArionComply LLM Testing Infrastructure

## Purpose
Testing and validation infrastructure for LLM parameter optimization in compliance use cases. Designed to work with the existing ArionComply platform while remaining modular and configurable.

## Architecture Principles
- **Modular:** Each component can be modified/replaced independently
- **Configurable:** All endpoints and services configurable via JSON
- **Non-intrusive:** Extends existing ArionComply code without modification
- **Incremental:** Built and tested in phases
- **JSON-first:** All configuration in JSON format
