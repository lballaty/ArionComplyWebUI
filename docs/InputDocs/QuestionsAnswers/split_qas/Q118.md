### 118) What’s the process for renewing certifications and how often does it happen?

**Standard terms**  
- **Surveillance (ISO 17021-1 Cl. 7.3):** annual audits between recertification.  
- **Internal audit (ISO 27001 Cl. 9.2):** ensures readiness.

**Plain-English answer**  
Certification runs on a **3-year cycle** with annual surveillance audits. You must pass surveillance—plus internal audits—each year and undergo full recertification in Year 3.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Clause 7.3; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 9.2

**Why it matters**  
Proactive planning avoids lapses and audit bottlenecks.
