### 32) Do we need to hire expensive consultants or can we do this ourselves?

**Standard terms)**
- **Awareness & competence (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.2):** you need trained staff to implement controls.

**Plain-English answer**
You can DIY core ISMS tasks—our platform auto-generates policies, workflows, and evidence templates—reducing consultancy needs by ~90%. You may still want expert review for complex risk or legal interpretation, but routine implementation is self-service.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.2

**Why it matters**
Balancing cost vs expertise ensures quality without overspend.

**Do next in our platform**
- Review **skill gaps** via our competence matrix.
- Decide on **consultant engagements** for high-risk areas only.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Competence tracker.
- **[Workflow]** Guided implementation steps.
- **[Report]** Effort vs consultancy savings.

**Likely follow-ups**
