## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of asset management like managing a sophisticated logistics operation for a global shipping company.** Just as FedEx tracks millions of packages through complex networks with real-time visibility, precise location tracking, condition monitoring, and automated routing decisions, organizations must systematically identify, catalog, track, and protect their information assets throughout their entire lifecycle. Each package has specific handling requirements, value classifications, and delivery priorities - similarly, each information asset requires appropriate protection based on its classification, business value, and risk profile.

Effective asset management provides the **foundation for all security controls** - you cannot protect what you cannot see, and you cannot prioritize protection without understanding what you have and its relative value.
