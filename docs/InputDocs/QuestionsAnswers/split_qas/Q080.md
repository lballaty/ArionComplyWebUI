### 80) How do we write policies that actually work vs. just check compliance boxes?

**Standard terms**  
- **Documented information (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.5):** requirements for policies and records.

**Plain-English answer**  
Effective policies tie controls to business processes, assign clear roles, and include measurable criteria (e.g., “encrypt all data at rest with AES-256”). Involve stakeholders to ensure buy-in and applicability.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.5

**Why it matters**  
Actionable policies drive real security rather than superficial compliance.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Open **Policy Authoring** workflow.  
- Customize templates to your context.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Draft Doc]** Pre-filled policy templates.  
- **[Workflow]** Review and approval routing.  

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “What should a policy template include?” (Scope, roles, metrics)

**Sources**
