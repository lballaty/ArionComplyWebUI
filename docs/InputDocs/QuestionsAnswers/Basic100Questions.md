## 1) What is ISO 27001 and why does everyone keep talking about it?
**Plain-English answer**  
ISO 27001 is the globally recognized rulebook for building an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**—a set of policies, roles, processes, and controls that manage security risks. You can be **audited** by an accredited body and get a **certificate**, which many customers require. Think “how we run security,” not just “tools we bought.”

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Clauses 4–10, Annex A)  
**Also relevant:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 (control guidance), ISO/IEC 27701:2019 (privacy extension)

**Why it matters**  
It’s the most recognized way to signal trust and structure your security program end-to-end.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Create your **ISMS scope**, start the **risk register**, and generate a **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**.  
- Import your policies and map them to controls and evidence.  
- **Automation:** We pre-map Annex A controls and generate evidence tasks—cutting setup effort by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- What’s an ISMS exactly? (See Q10)  
- How long/cost to get certified? (See Q31, Q51)

**Sources**  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Clauses 4–10; Annex A

---

## 2) What’s the difference between a “standard” and a “regulation” and why does it matter?
**Plain-English answer**  
A **standard** (e.g., ISO 27001) is **voluntary** guidance you can certify against. A **regulation** (e.g., GDPR, EU AI Act) is **law**—authorities can enforce and fine you. You **certify** to standards; you **comply** with regulations. (NIS2 is a Directive—implemented in national law.)

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** EU law concepts; ISO standards  
**Also relevant:** GDPR (Reg. 2016/679), EU AI Act (Reg. 2024/1689), NIS2 (Directive 2022/2555)

**Why it matters**  
Knowing what is optional vs. legally required sets priorities and risk.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Tag each requirement as **Standard** or **Regulation**; generate separate roadmaps.  
- **Automation:** Our crosswalk engine links overlapping requirements—reducing duplicate work by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- If it’s a Directive (NIS2), what do we follow today? (Your Member State’s transposition.)

**Sources**  
- GDPR (EU 2016/679); NIS2 (EU 2022/2555); EU AI Act (EU 2024/1689)

---

## 3) Is GDPR just a European thing or does it affect my US/non-EU company too?
**Plain-English answer**  
Yes, GDPR can apply outside the EU if you **offer goods/services to EU/EEA individuals** or **monitor** them, or if you have an **EU establishment** involved in processing.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 3 (Territorial scope)  
**Also relevant:** EDPB Guidelines on Art. 3

**Do next in our platform**  
- Flag **EU data subjects** in the data inventory; assign **legal bases**.  
- **Automation:** Our “GDPR scope check” and templates reduce scoping work by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do we need an **EU representative** if we’re non-EU?

**Sources**  
- GDPR Art. 3; EDPB Guidelines 3/2018 (territorial scope)

---

## 4) What does “getting certified” actually mean and what do I get at the end?
**Plain-English answer**  
For ISO standards, an independent **certification body** audits your ISMS. If you pass, you get a **certificate** (valid ~3 years) with annual **surveillance audits**. GDPR/NIS2/CPRA don’t issue government “compliance certificates” (GDPR has optional certifications under Arts. 42–43 but they don’t replace legal obligations).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022; ISO/IEC 17021-1 (certification cycle)  
**Also relevant:** GDPR Arts. 42–43

**Do next in our platform**  
- Map ISO clauses to evidence; schedule **internal audit** and **management review**.  
- **Automation:** We generate the audit calendar, evidence packs, and NC/CAP tracking—saving ~90% admin.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Who accredits the certification body? (National accreditation bodies, e.g., UKAS, DAkkS.)

**Sources**  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022; ISO/IEC 17021-1; GDPR Arts. 42–43

---

## 5) Are these compliance things optional or will I get in legal trouble if I ignore them?
**Plain-English answer**  
**Standards** (ISO 27001/27701) are optional unless contractually required. **Regulations** (GDPR, CPRA, EU AI Act) are **mandatory** if you’re in scope; NIS2 duties apply via Member State laws to covered sectors/entities.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR; CPRA; EU AI Act; NIS2

**Do next in our platform**  
- Mark each requirement **Legal** vs **Voluntary**; assign owners and deadlines.  
- **Automation:** Our regulator matrix tracks applicability and deadlines—cutting effort by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Are we in **NIS2** scope? (See Q12)

**Sources**  
- GDPR (EU 2016/679); CPRA (Cal. Civ. Code §1798); EU AI Act (EU 2024/1689); NIS2 (EU 2022/2555)

---

## 6) What’s the difference between being “compliant” and being “certified”?
**Plain-English answer**  
**Compliant**: you meet legal or standard requirements (self-evidenced). **Certified**: a third-party auditor verified you against a certifiable standard (e.g., ISO 27001). You can’t be “certified to GDPR/NIS2/CPRA” by law; GDPR has **optional** certifications.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO 27001; GDPR Art. 42

**Do next in our platform**  
- Maintain a controls/evidence dashboard for **both** standards and legal duties.  
- **Automation:** We auto-map evidence to requirements—~90% less manual filing.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Does a GDPR certification reduce fines? (It can be a mitigating factor.)

**Sources**  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022; GDPR Art. 42

---

## 7) Why are there so many different standards and regulations—can’t I just do one?
**Plain-English answer**  
They address **different things**: ISO 27001 = how to **run security**; GDPR/CPRA = **privacy rights and duties**; NIS2 = **sectoral cyber resilience**; EU AI Act = **AI risk management & transparency**. There’s overlap you can **reuse** (risk, access control, incident response).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO 27001, GDPR, CPRA, NIS2, EU AI Act

**Do next in our platform**  
- Turn on **cross-mapping**; maintain a single **evidence library** reused across frameworks.  
- **Automation:** Our crosswalks eliminate most duplicate work (≈90%).

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Which overlaps are biggest? (Risk management, incident response, supplier security.)

**Sources**  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022; GDPR; CPRA; NIS2; EU AI Act

---

## 8) What is a Data Protection Officer and do I need to hire one?
**Plain-English answer**  
A **DPO** advises on GDPR, monitors compliance, and liaises with regulators. You must appoint one if you do **large-scale monitoring** or process **large-scale special-category data**, or you’re a **public authority**.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Arts. 37–39

**Do next in our platform**  
- Record your **DPO decision** (required/not + rationale). If needed, add DPO contact to notices.  
- **Automation:** Our DPO decision assistant and templates replace outside counsel for routine needs—saving time/cost.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Can our GC or CISO be DPO without conflict? (Be careful—independence is required.)

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 37–39

---

## 9) What does “personal data” actually include—is it just names and emails?
**Plain-English answer**  
Personal data is **any information** about an **identified or identifiable** person—direct (name, email) or indirect (IDs, location, cookie IDs, device IDs, biometrics). Some types are **special category** (e.g., health).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 4(1)  
**Also relevant:** CPRA §1798.140 (personal information)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Classify data elements; flag **special categories** and trigger DPIAs as needed.  
- **Automation:** Our data dictionary and PII tagging speed setup by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Is IP address personal? (Often yes, context-dependent.)

**Sources**  
- GDPR Art. 4(1); CPRA §1798.140

---

## 10) What is an “information security management system”—is it software I need to buy?
**Plain-English answer**  
An **ISMS** is how your org **runs security** (policies, roles, processes, records, controls). ISO 27001 defines requirements; software helps operate and prove it, but the ISMS is **not** just a tool.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Clauses 4–10)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Configure policies, risk, assets, SoA, internal audit, and management review.  
- **Automation:** We generate workflows/evidence so your ISMS runs with ~90% less manual admin.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- What’s the minimum viable ISMS? (Scope, policies, risk, SoA, audit, review.)

**Sources**  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022

---

## 11) How do I know if my company needs to comply with GDPR?
**Plain-English answer**  
GDPR applies if you process personal data about **EU/EEA** individuals (material scope) and you’re established in the EU **or** target/monitor EU individuals (territorial scope).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Arts. 2–3

**Do next in our platform**  
- Run the **GDPR scope check**; start a **RoPA** for EU processing.  
- **Automation:** One-click scope tagging + templates cut effort by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do we need an **EU representative**? (Non-EU with EU targeting/monitoring.)

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 2–3

---

## 12) What makes a company “essential” under NIS2—are we big enough to worry?
**Plain-English answer**  
NIS2 classifies covered entities by **sector** and **size**. **Annex I** sectors are “essential”; **Annex II** are “important.” Some smaller entities are covered due to criticality (e.g., key providers).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** NIS2 Art. 2; Annexes I–II; Arts. 32–34 (oversight/fines)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Use the **NIS2 sector/size checker**; start the **risk-management controls**.  
- **Automation:** Pre-built NIS2 controls/workflows save most setup time.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Are we a covered **managed service/cloud** provider?

**Sources**  
- NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555, Art. 2; Annex I–II

---

## 13) We’re a small business with 20 employees—do we really need ISO 27001?
**Plain-English answer**  
It’s **voluntary**, but many SMEs adopt it to win enterprise deals and bring structure. It scales to small teams and can be phased.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022

**Do next in our platform**  
- Use **ISMS quick scope**; run a **gap analysis** and prioritize must-haves.  
- **Automation:** Pre-mapped controls/evidence reduce lift by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Are customers/tenders demanding ISO 27001? (See Q28)

**Sources**  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (scope & applicability)

---

## 14) We only operate in one country—why are people talking about international regulations?
**Plain-English answer**  
Because laws can apply based on your **data subjects**, not just where you’re incorporated. Example: serve EU residents online ⇒ GDPR can apply; handle Californians’ data ⇒ CPRA may apply.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 3; CPRA scope

**Do next in our platform**  
- Use the **jurisdiction mapper** and generate a **multi-reg register**.  
- **Automation:** We track regional thresholds and alerts—~90% less manual checking.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do we cross **CPRA** thresholds? Are we in an **NIS2** sector?

**Sources**  
- GDPR Art. 3; CPRA §1798.140/§1798.155 (scope/enforcement)

---

## 15) We just use cloud (O365, Salesforce)—does compliance still apply?
**Plain-English answer**  
Yes. You’re the **controller**; cloud vendors are **processors**. You need **DPAs** and **appropriate security**. Under NIS2, supply-chain/cloud risk is explicitly in scope.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Arts. 28, 32  
**Also relevant:** NIS2 Art. 21; ISO 27001 Annex A (supplier/cloud controls)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Onboard cloud vendors to **third-party risk**; attach **DPA**; map shared responsibility.  
- **Automation:** Built-in DPAs and control mappings slash effort by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Which controls are **ours** vs. the cloud’s?

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 28, 32; NIS2 Art. 21

---

## 16) We’re B2B only—do privacy laws still matter if we don’t have consumers?
**Plain-English answer**  
Yes. GDPR protects **natural persons** (employees, business contacts). B2B emails like firstname.lastname@company are personal data. CPRA also covers employees/B2B contacts.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR (material scope)  
**Also relevant:** CPRA (§1798.140 definitions)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Include **B2B contacts & employees** in your data inventory; set lawful bases/retention.  
- **Automation:** Templates and bulk import reduce setup by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do our B2B marketing emails need consent or another lawful basis?

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 2, 4(1); CPRA §1798.140

---

## 17) We’re a subsidiary—who’s responsible for compliance?
**Plain-English answer**  
Under GDPR, the **controller** is the entity deciding purposes/means. Group companies can be **joint controllers**, but each entity can be liable. ISO 27001 certification covers the **defined scope** (could be only the subsidiary).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 4(7), Art. 26  
**Also relevant:** ISO 27001 Clause 4.3 (scope)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Model **legal entities** and **processing roles**; define ISMS scope to the right entity.  
- **Automation:** Intra-group agreement templates and role tagging speed setup.

**Sources**  
- GDPR Art. 4(7), Art. 26; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3

---

## 18) We’re a startup—when do we need to start worrying?
**Plain-English answer**  
If you process EU personal data, **GDPR applies from day one**. NIS2 depends on sector/size but can still affect critical suppliers. ISO 27001 is optional but often **sales-driven**.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 3  
**Also relevant:** NIS2 Recitals/Art. 2; ISO 27001

**Do next in our platform**  
- Enable **minimum viable privacy/security**: data map, policies, MFA/backups, IR playbook.  
- **Automation:** Our quick-start blueprints get you running in days vs. months.

**Sources**  
- GDPR Art. 3; NIS2 Art. 2; ISO/IEC 27001:2022

---

## 19) Do non-profits and charities follow the same rules?
**Plain-English answer**  
GDPR applies regardless of profit status if you process EU personal data. CPRA generally covers **for-profit** businesses; many non-profits aren’t “businesses” under CPRA, but may be processors/service providers.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Arts. 2–3  
**Also relevant:** CPRA §1798.140 (“business” definition)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Run **jurisdiction scope**; document CPRA applicability (likely “no” for many non-profits).  
- **Automation:** Policy/notice templates speed compliance without outside counsel.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do our vendors need CPRA-compliant terms even if we’re a non-profit? (Often yes.)

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 2–3; CPRA §1798.140

---

## 20) We only process employee data—does GDPR still apply internally?
**Plain-English answer**  
Yes. Employee data is personal data. Member States can add extra employment-context rules. You must still follow GDPR basics (lawful basis, security, transparency).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 88 (employment context)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Add **HR systems** to the data map; generate an **employee privacy notice**; set retention.  
- **Automation:** Pre-built HR records and notices reduce setup by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do we need a DPIA for monitoring? (Risk-based—often yes.)

**Sources**  
- GDPR Art. 88

---

## 21) What are the actual penalties for GDPR violations—how likely is a fine?
**Plain-English answer**  
Fines can be up to **€20M or 4%** of global annual turnover (whichever is higher) for serious infringements. Authorities consider factors like severity, mitigation, and cooperation.

**Applies to**

- How do we handle cross-border complaints? (One-stop-shop may apply.)

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 77, 79, 82

---

## 23) What happens if we fail an ISO 27001 audit—legal trouble?
**Plain-English answer**  
No legal penalty. You’ll receive **nonconformities** (minor/major). Majors must be fixed before certification; minors need corrective action by the next review.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO 27001; ISO/IEC 17021-1 (certification process)

**Do next in our platform**  
- Use the **NC/CAP tracker** (owners, deadlines, evidence); schedule follow-up.  
- **Automation:** We auto-generate CAPs from findings—cutting admin by ~90%.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- How long to fix a major? (Typically before cert issuance; CB policies vary.)

**Sources**  
- ISO/IEC 17021-1 (audit program & nonconformities)

---

## 24) Are there criminal penalties for cybersecurity violations or just civil fines?
**Plain-English answer**  
GDPR allows Member States to set **other penalties** (including potential criminal ones) in national law. NIS2 requires administrative fines and national penalties; some countries may add criminal offences in transposition.

- GDPR Art. 84; NIS2 Arts. 32–36

---

## 25) Can we lose our business license if we’re not compliant?
**Plain-English answer**  
Authorities can order a **ban or restriction on processing** (GDPR Art. 58(2)), which can halt services. Sector regulators (or NIS2 authorities) can impose orders/fines; license impacts depend on national/sector law.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 58(2)  
**Also relevant:** NIS2 Arts. 32–34

**Do next in our platform**  
- Map **critical processing** so you know which services a ban would impact.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Which services fail if processing is restricted?

**Sources**  
- GDPR Art. 58(2); NIS2 Arts. 32–34

---

## 26) What if we have a data breach before we’re fully compliant—are we automatically in violation?
**Plain-English answer**  
A breach isn’t an automatic violation. Authorities look at whether you had **appropriate security** and whether you **notified** on time (72h to authority when required; notify people if high risk).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Arts. 32, 33–34

**Do next in our platform**  
- Use the **breach wizard** to assess risk and generate notices.  
- **Automation:** We handle timelines, templates, and evidence—reducing scramble by ~90%.

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 32, 33–34

---

## 27) Do insurance companies care about compliance certificates for cyber insurance?
**Plain-English answer**  
Insurers focus on **controls** (MFA, EDR, backups, IR plans). Certifications help demonstrate maturity but aren’t guarantees; underwriting rests on control strength.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** Market practice; ISO 27001 as assurance

**Do next in our platform**  
- Export an **underwriter-ready** control pack (MFA, EDR, backups, IR).

**Sources**  
- Common enterprise supplier requirements (industry practice); GDPR Art. 28(1)

---

## 29) What’s the difference between regulatory penalties and civil lawsuits?
**Plain-English answer**  
**Regulatory penalties**: fines/orders from authorities (e.g., GDPR Art. 83; processing bans via Art. 58). **Civil lawsuits**: individuals (or groups) sue for **compensation** (e.g., GDPR Art. 82). You can face both.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Arts. 58, 82–83

**Do next in our platform**  
- Keep **evidence** of decisions, DPIAs, and contracts for both regulators and courts.

**Sources**  
- GDPR Arts. 58, 82–83

---

## 30) Are there any “safe harbors” or exceptions that might protect us?
**Plain-English answer**  
No universal safe harbor. Under GDPR, adherence to **codes of conduct** or **certifications** can be **mitigating factors** when setting fines. CPRA removed the automatic 30-day cure period (agencies may allow cures at their discretion).

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** GDPR Art. 83(2)(j)  
**Also relevant:** CPRA §1798.155 (enforcement)

**Do next in our platform**

---

## 32) Do we need to hire expensive consultants or can we do this ourselves?
**Plain-English answer**  
You can self-implement if you assign owners and follow the standard’s **competence** and **documentation** requirements; many firms bring targeted help to compress timelines.

**Applies to**  
**Primary:** ISO 27001 Clauses 7.2 (competence), 7.5 (documented info), 9.2 (internal audit), 9.3 (management review)

**Do next in our platform**
