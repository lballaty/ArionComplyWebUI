### 102) Will our customers notice any changes when we implement compliance?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Awareness & competence (Cl. 7.3):** training staff on how to communicate changes.

**Plain-English answer**  
Customers may see updated privacy notices, new consent banners, and occasionally requests for updated SLAs. Most security changes are backend and transparent; clear communication builds trust.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.3

**Why it matters**  
Proactive communication minimizes confusion and enhances reputation.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch **Customer Comm** workflow.  
- Manage stakeholder messages in register.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Templates for customer emails and portal notices.  
- **[Dashboard]** Tracks sent communications and acknowledgments.

**Likely follow-ups**
