### 144) How do we present our program to auditors to minimize findings?

**Standard terms**  
- **Internal audit (ISO 27001 Cl.9.2):** demonstrates control effectiveness.

**Plain-English answer**  
Provide **concise evidence packs**: link control objectives to records, highlight continuous monitoring data, and include context notes explaining deviations. Use a narrative flow—scope, risk approach, control implementation, ongoing review.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 9.2

**Why it matters**  
Clear presentation reduces misunderstandings and misclassified findings.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Start **Audit Prep** workflow.  
- Generate **Evidence Pack** for each control.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Auto-assemble evidence by control.  
- **[Report]** Generates slide decks and control maps.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “What level of detail do auditors expect?” (Refer to CB checklist)
