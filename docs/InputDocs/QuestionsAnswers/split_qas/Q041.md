### 41) How much employee time does compliance preparation take?

**Standard terms)**
- **Awareness & competence (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.2):** training and skill activities.  
- **DPO tasks (GDPR Art. 39):** time for monitoring and reporting.  
- **PIMS roles (ISO 27701 Sect. 5.3):** privacy-specific responsibilities.
