### 51) How long does it take to get ISO 27001 certified from when we start?

**Standard terms)**
- **Planning & objectives (ISO 27001 Cl. 6.2):** defines treatment plans and schedule.  
- **Audit program (ISO 17021-1 Cl. 7):** sets audit duration and intervals.

**Plain-English answer**  
Typical small-to-mid scopes take **6–9 months** end-to-end: 2–3 months for GAP analysis & planning, 3–5 months to implement controls, then 1–2 months to complete Stage 1/2 audits and address findings.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 6.2; ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Clause 7

**Why it matters**  
Setting realistic timelines avoids resource overload and keeps stakeholders aligned.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Use the **Certification Timeline** planner to slot tasks.  
- Lock in auditor availability dates.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Planner]** Gantt view of all milestones.  
- **[Dashboard]** Progress tracking versus plan.  
- **[Reminder]** Notifications ahead of each phase.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “What if we finish controls early?” (Accelerate audit scheduling)
