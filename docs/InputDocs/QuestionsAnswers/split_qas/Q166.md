### 166) What safeguards must we apply before sending data abroad for business purposes?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Appropriate safeguards (GDPR Art. 44):** legal tools ensuring GDPR-level protection.

**Plain-English answer**  
Pick one safeguard **before** any transfer:  
1. **Adequacy decision** (best).  
2. **SCCs** (most common).  
3. **Binding Corporate Rules** (for group transfers).  
4. **Specific derogation** (rare, e.g., explicit consent).

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 44

**Why it matters**  
Transfers without safeguards are unlawful and trigger hefty fines.
