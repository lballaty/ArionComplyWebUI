### 164) What is a Data Protection Impact Assessment for cross-border transfers?

**Standard terms)**  
- **DPIA (GDPR Art. 35):** structured risk analysis for high-risk processing.

**Plain-English answer**  
A **Transfer DPIA** evaluates privacy risks (e.g., third-country surveillance laws) and documents safeguards—encryption, SCCs, minimisation—before data leaves the EEA.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 35

**Why it matters**  
Supervisory authorities expect a DPIA for large-scale or sensitive transfers.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch the **DPIA Wizard**; answer guided risk questions.  
- Store the signed DPIA in the **DPIA Log**.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Auto-populates transfer details; links to SCCs.  
- **[Draft Doc]** Exports final DPIA PDF.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do we need to consult the **lead DPA**?  
- How often should we review a DPIA?
