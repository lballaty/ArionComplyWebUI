### 14) What makes a company “essential” under NIS2 — are we big enough to worry?

**Standard terms)**
- **Scope (NIS2 Art. 2–3):** applies to medium+ entities in Annex I sectors; some small entities may be included.
- **Essential entities (Annex I):** sectors like energy, transport, health.
- **Important entities (Annex II):** digital services, manufacturing, food.

**Plain-English answer**
NIS2 covers **medium** and **large** organizations in critical sectors listed in Annex I. Annex II covers “important” but less critical services. Very small players generally fall outside, but Member States can tweak thresholds **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Directive 2022/2555 Articles 2–3; Annex I
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3

**Why it matters**
Being in-scope triggers mandatory risk management, incident reporting, and governance duties.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **Sector & Size** wizard.
- If in-scope, map controls to NIS2 obligations.
- Enable incident reporting workflows.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Sector and size classification.
- **[Tracker]** NIS2 risk register and incident logs.
- **[Workflow]** Authority reporting processes.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Which national law applies?” (Where you’re established **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Can ISO 27001 satisfy parts of NIS2?” (Yes—governance controls overlap)

**Sources**
- NIS2 Directive 2022/2555 Articles 2–3; Annex I
