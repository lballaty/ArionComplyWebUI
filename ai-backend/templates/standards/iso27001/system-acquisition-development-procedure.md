## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of system development like constructing a high-security government facility with classified information processing capabilities.** Just as such construction requires security architects from day one, threat assessments during design, security inspections at every phase, hardened materials and construction methods, comprehensive testing before occupancy, and ongoing security maintenance throughout the facility's lifecycle, software and system development must integrate security considerations from initial requirements through deployment and ongoing operations.

Secure System Development provides **comprehensive security integration** throughout the entire system lifecycle, ensuring that security is not an afterthought but a fundamental architectural component that protects organizational assets and data from the moment systems become operational.
