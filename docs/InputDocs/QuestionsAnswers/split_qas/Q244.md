### 244) If the same type of incident happens again, are penalties worse?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Fines (GDPR Art.83):** criteria include history of infringements.

**Plain-English answer**  
Yes—GDPR fines consider **repeat offenses**, your remediation efforts, and any negligence. A second breach of the same nature typically results in higher fines or stricter corrective orders.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 83

**Why it matters**  
Encourages robust remediation; repeat lapses signal systemic failures to regulators.
