### üèóÔ∏è JSON Data Structure

```yaml
# Root Level: Framework Keys
{
  "Framework Name": [ /* Array of question objects */ ],

## üîÑ Integration Dependencies & Usage

### üì• Consumed BY (Question Loaders)

```yaml
- wizard-engine.js:
    uses: framework jsonKey to load appropriate question set
    example: COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS['eu_ai_act'].jsonKey ‚Üí "EU AI ACT Onboarding Questionaire"

- questionLoader.js:
    uses: question arrays to populate wizard steps
    processes: step groupings and question sequencing

- wizard interface (wizzard.html):
    displays: questions based on current step and framework selection
    handles: user responses and progress tracking
```

### üì§ Provides TO (Wizard System)

```yaml
- Question Content: actual assessment questions for each framework
- Step Structure: logical grouping of questions by assessment phase
- Progress Mapping: question count for progress calculation
- Content Validation: professional, compliance-focused question content
```

### üéØ Critical Usage Patterns

```yaml
framework_selection:
  1. User selects framework from navigation (eu_ai_act, iso_27001, etc.)
  2. wizard-engine.js gets framework config from COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS
  3. Uses config.jsonKey to lookup questions in onboarding_questions.json
  4. questionLoader.js processes questions by step groupings
  5. Questions displayed sequentially in wizard interface

step_navigation:
  - Questions grouped by "step" field (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
  - Step titles provide context and navigation structure
  - Questions within steps processed sequentially by array index
  - Progress calculated based on total question count per framework
```

---

## üìä Question Quality & Content Analysis

### üéØ Professional Assessment Design

```yaml
question_characteristics:
  - Comprehensive coverage of framework requirements
  - Professional compliance terminology and phrasing
  - Progressive complexity (basic ‚Üí advanced topics)
  - Actionable and implementable focus
  - Regulatory alignment with actual standards

content_validation:
  - EU AI Act: covers all major obligation categories
  - ISO 27001: aligns with Annex A controls and ISMS requirements
  - GDPR: includes latest regulatory guidance and technical measures
  - ISO 42001: addresses AI lifecycle and governance comprehensively
  - ISO 27701: integrates privacy controls with ISMS framework
  - Cloud Security: addresses both ISO 27017 and 27018 requirements
```

### üîç Advanced Integration Features

```yaml
cross_framework_elements:
  - GDPR assessment includes extensive AI governance questions (58 in Step 8)
  - ISO 27701 includes automated decision-making considerations
  - Multiple frameworks address risk management and documentation
  - Vendor/third-party assessments appear across multiple frameworks

scalability_design:
  - JSON structure supports easy addition of new frameworks
  - "Cross Standard Onboarding Questionaire" placeholder for future use
  - Question objects can be extended with additional metadata
  - Step-based organization supports flexible wizard navigation
```

## üß™ Critical Testing & Validation Points

### üéØ Data Integrity Tests

```yaml
1. JSON Structure Validation:
  - Valid JSON syntax and structure
  - All framework keys present and accessible
  - Question objects contain required "step" and "question" fields
  - No duplicate questions within frameworks

2. Integration Consistency:
  - All jsonKey values from navigation-config.js have matching keys
  - Question counts match framework metadata exactly
  - Step counts align with framework configuration
  - No missing or extra frameworks

3. Content Quality:
  - All questions have meaningful content (no empty strings)
  - Step titles follow consistent naming convention
  - Questions are actionable and answerable
  - Professional terminology and phrasing
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration Dependencies to Test

```yaml
- Must test WITH navigation-config.js (jsonKey matching)
- Must test WITH wizard-engine.js (framework selection and loading)
- Must test WITH questionLoader.js (question processing and display)
- Must validate question counts match progress calculations
- Must ensure step navigation works with question groupings
- Must test framework switching and question set loading
```

### üìä Performance & Scalability Considerations

```yaml
data_size:
  - Total questions across all frameworks: ~326 questions
  - JSON file size: manageable for browser loading
  - No images or large content - text-only questions
  - Framework switching requires minimal data transfer

loading_strategy:
  - Entire JSON loaded once and cached
  - Framework-specific question sets extracted as needed
  - Step-based processing for progressive loading
  - Minimal memory footprint per framework
```
