## **1. Policy Foundation**

### **1.1 Understanding Human Resources Security**

Think of human resources security like building and maintaining a trusted team for a high-security operation. Just as a government intelligence agency must carefully vet, train, and manage its personnel throughout their careers - from initial recruitment through retirement - organizations must implement comprehensive security measures throughout the entire employee lifecycle to protect their most valuable assets: information and systems.

**Real-World Analogy**: Consider how a bank manages its employees:
- **Pre-Employment**: Like conducting thorough background checks before hiring tellers who will handle money
- **Onboarding**: Like providing extensive training on security procedures and bank policies
- **Ongoing Management**: Like regular training updates and periodic security reviews
- **Access Management**: Like ensuring employees only have access to the vaults and systems they need
- **Incident Response**: Like having clear procedures when an employee reports suspicious activity
- **Termination**: Like immediately revoking access and collecting all bank property when someone leaves

Each stage requires different security considerations and controls to maintain the trust and security of the institution.

### **1.2 Policy Purpose**

This policy establishes a comprehensive framework to:
- **Secure the Employment Lifecycle**: Implement security controls throughout employment phases
- **Manage Human Risk**: Identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with personnel
- **Ensure Competency**: Maintain appropriate security knowledge and skills
- **Protect Information Assets**: Safeguard information through proper personnel management
- **Maintain Compliance**: Meet regulatory and legal requirements for personnel security

### **1.3 Policy Scope**

This policy applies to:
- **All Personnel**: Employees, contractors, temporary staff, and interns
- **All Employment Phases**: Pre-employment, onboarding, employment, and termination
- **All Roles**: From entry-level positions to executive management
- **All Locations**: On-site, remote, hybrid, and traveling employees
- **All Employment Types**: Full-time, part-time, contract, and temporary positions
