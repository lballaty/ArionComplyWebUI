### 174) Do we need special consent for AI processing vs. regular data processing?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **Lawfulness of processing (GDPR Art. 6):** defines valid legal bases for processing personal data.  
- **Special categories of data (GDPR Art. 9):** require explicit consent or other specific conditions.  
- **Transparency requirements (EU AI Act Art. 13):** obligations to inform users they are interacting with or subject to an AI system.

**Plain-English answer**  
Under GDPR, AI processing follows the same legal basis rules as other data processing, but the nature of AI (e.g., automated decision-making, profiling) often triggers additional transparency and safeguard obligations. If the AI processes special categories of personal data (such as health or biometric data), explicit consent is generally required unless another lawful exception applies. The EU AI Act also requires clear disclosure when users interact with AI, or when AI generates content, which may mean updating consent forms and notices.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 6 & 9  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** EU AI Act Article 13

**Why it matters**  
Failure to secure appropriate consent or provide transparency can result in noncompliance with both GDPR and the AI Act.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch the **Consent Update** workflow to review and adapt consent forms for AI use cases.  
- Check the **Consent Register** to verify records cover AI-specific processing purposes.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Report]** Identify processing activities that may require AI-specific consent or disclosures.  
- **[Draft Doc]** Generate updated consent language and privacy notices.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “If our AI uses anonymized data, do we still need consent?” (No, if truly anonymized and not re-identifiable) [LOCAL LAW CHECK]
