### 33) How much do the certification audits cost and how often do we pay them?

**Standard terms)**
- **Audit program (ISO 17021-1 Cl. 7):** defines audit frequency and fees.

**Plain-English answer**
Certification audits comprise an initial 2-stage audit (€5 k–€15 k), annual surveillance audits (~€3 k–€8 k each), and a full recertification audit every 3 years (~same as initial). Exact fees depend on scope and CB.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Clause 7

**Why it matters**
Budgeting for ongoing audit fees is critical to maintain certification.
