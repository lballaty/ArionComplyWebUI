### 35) Do we need to hire new staff or can our existing team handle this?

**Standard terms)**
- **Resources (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.1):** organization must determine and provide needed resources.

**Plain-English answer**
Most customers run compliance with existing staff using our platform—automated templates and workflows cut manual effort by ~80%. You may need a part-time ISMS owner and a compliance coordinator, but no full-time team.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.1

**Why it matters**
Optimizing headcount lowers OPEX and speeds roll-out.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run **resource-gap analysis**.
- Assign **roles** and estimate FTEs.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Resource and skill tracker.
- **[Planner]** Role assignment wizard.
- **[Report]** Staffing impact summary.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What skillsets are essential?” (See Q079–Q080)
