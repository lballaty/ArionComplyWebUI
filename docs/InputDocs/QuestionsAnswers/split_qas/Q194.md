### 194) Should we join industry associations or compliance groups?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **Communication (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.4):** internal and external communications relevant to the ISMS.  
- **Communication (ISO 27701 Cl. 7.4):** privacy-related communication and collaboration.

**Plain-English answer**  
Yes. Industry associations and compliance groups such as **ISACA**, **IAPP**, **Cloud Security Alliance**, and sector-specific bodies (e.g., Financial Services Information Sharing groups) offer best practices, training, peer networking, and early awareness of new requirements. Membership can also strengthen your organization’s credibility and benchmarking capabilities.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.4; ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 7.4

**Why it matters**  
Membership provides access to expert resources, peer experiences, and timely regulatory updates.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Review the **Association Directory** register.  
- Tag relevant groups for membership and assign internal contacts.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Report]** Comparative analysis of association benefits and focus areas.  
- **[Planner]** Track membership renewals and event participation.

**Likely follow-ups**
