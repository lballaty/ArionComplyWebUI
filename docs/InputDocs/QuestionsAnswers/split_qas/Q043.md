### 43) Do we need to change our business processes and how disruptive is that?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Scope (ISO 27001 Cl. 4.3):** defines which processes are in scope.  
- **Operational control (Cl. 8.1):** you must plan and manage controls.

**Plain-English answer**  
You’ll need to adapt processes for risk assessment, incident management, and reviews. For most, these are ~10 % tweaks—automating workflows cuts manual hand-offs and minimizes disruption.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 4.3; 8.1
