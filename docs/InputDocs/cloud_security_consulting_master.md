## Section 7: Glossary of Terms and Concepts

*This glossary assumes no prior knowledge of cloud security concepts. Each term is explained in practical business context with implementation implications.*

### **A**

**API Gateway**: A service that acts as an entry point for APIs, providing security controls such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and monitoring. In cloud environments, API gateways are essential for managing access to microservices and serverless functions. They provide a centralized point for implementing security policies, monitoring API usage, and protecting backend services from direct exposure.

**Auto-Scaling**: The automatic adjustment of computing resources based on demand, which presents unique security challenges as new instances must be securely configured and monitored. Security considerations include ensuring new instances receive proper security configurations, maintaining consistent security baselines across scaling events, and monitoring for security anomalies during scale-up/scale-down events.

### **C**

**Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**: A security control point that sits between cloud service users and cloud applications to extend security policies beyond an organization's infrastructure. CASBs provide visibility into cloud application usage, data protection through encryption and access controls, threat protection against malware and unauthorized access, and compliance assistance through policy enforcement and monitoring.

**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Tools and practices for identifying and remedying security risks and compliance issues in cloud environments. CSPM solutions continuously monitor cloud configurations, identify security gaps and misconfigurations, provide remediation guidance, and maintain compliance with security standards and regulatory requirements.

**Container Security**: The protection of containerized applications and the container runtime environment, including image scanning, runtime protection, and orchestration security. Container security involves securing the entire container lifecycle from development through production, including vulnerability scanning of container images, runtime behavior monitoring, and security policy enforcement in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

### **D**

**Data Residency**: Requirements that specify where data must be physically stored, processed, or transmitted, often driven by regulatory or sovereignty requirements. Organizations must understand which jurisdictions their data resides in, implement controls to ensure compliance with local data protection laws, and maintain documentation of data locations for audit and compliance purposes.

**DevSecOps**: The integration of security practices into the DevOps process, emphasizing security as code, automated security testing, and continuous security monitoring throughout the application lifecycle. In cloud environments, DevSecOps includes infrastructure as code security scanning, container image vulnerability assessment, API security testing, and automated compliance checking.

### **E**

**Egress Filtering**: Network security controls that monitor and restrict outbound network traffic from cloud environments, helping prevent data exfiltration and unauthorized communications. Effective egress filtering involves defining allowed destinations and protocols, monitoring for anomalous outbound traffic patterns, and implementing data loss prevention measures.

### **F**

**Function as a Service (FaaS)**: A cloud computing model where applications are broken down into individual functions that run in stateless compute containers managed by the cloud provider. Security considerations for FaaS include function-level access controls, secure coding practices for serverless functions, monitoring and logging of function executions, and managing dependencies and third-party libraries.

### **H**

**Hybrid Cloud**: A computing environment that combines public cloud services with private cloud or on-premises infrastructure, connected through secure network links. Security challenges include maintaining consistent security policies across environments, securing data in transit between cloud and on-premises systems, managing identity and access across multiple environments, and coordinating incident response across hybrid infrastructure.

**Hypervisor Security**: Protection of the virtualization layer that enables multiple virtual machines to run on shared physical hardware. Hypervisor security involves securing the hypervisor software itself, implementing proper isolation between virtual machines, monitoring for hypervisor-level attacks, and maintaining secure configurations for virtualization management.

### **I**

**Identity Federation**: The linking of electronic identity and attributes across multiple identity management systems, enabling single sign-on across cloud services and on-premises systems. Federation security requires secure token exchange protocols, proper attribute mapping and filtering, strong authentication at identity providers, and monitoring of federated access patterns.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: The practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments. Security considerations include scanning IaC templates for security vulnerabilities, implementing security controls in infrastructure definitions, maintaining version control for infrastructure changes, and automated security testing of infrastructure deployments.

### **K**

**Key Management Service (KMS)**: Cloud-based services for creating, storing, and managing cryptographic keys used for encryption and digital signatures. Proper key management involves implementing strong access controls for key access, rotating keys regularly, maintaining key usage audit logs, and ensuring secure key storage and transmission.

### **L**

**Least Privilege**: The security principle of granting users, applications, and systems only the minimum access rights needed to perform their functions. In cloud environments, this involves implementing fine-grained permissions, regularly reviewing and adjusting access rights, using temporary credentials where possible, and monitoring for privilege escalation attempts.

### **M**

**Multi-Cloud**: The use of multiple cloud computing services from different providers, either for different workloads or for redundancy and risk mitigation. Multi-cloud security challenges include maintaining consistent security policies across providers, managing multiple identity systems, coordinating incident response across platforms, and ensuring secure data transfer between different cloud environments.

**Multi-Tenancy**: A cloud computing architecture where a single instance of software serves multiple customers (tenants), with proper isolation between tenant data and operations. Security considerations include ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing data leakage between tenants, implementing tenant-specific security policies, and monitoring for cross-tenant attacks.

### **N**

**Network Segmentation**: The practice of dividing a network into smaller segments to limit the scope of security breaches and improve traffic management. In cloud environments, this involves using virtual private clouds (VPCs), security groups, network access control lists (NACLs), and software-defined networking to create secure network boundaries.

### **O**

**Orchestration Security**: Security controls for container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, including pod security policies, role-based access control, network policies, and secrets management. This involves securing the orchestration control plane, implementing proper authentication and authorization, monitoring container runtime behavior, and managing secure communication between containers.

### **P**

**Privacy by Design**: The principle of embedding privacy protection into technology design from the beginning, rather than adding it as an afterthought. In cloud computing, this involves selecting cloud services with appropriate privacy controls, implementing data minimization practices, ensuring user consent management, and maintaining data subject rights capabilities.

### **R**

**Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**: Security technology that runs inside an application and monitors its behavior in real-time, providing immediate protection against attacks. RASP solutions can detect and block attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and application logic flaws as they occur, providing an additional layer of security for cloud-hosted applications.

### **S**

**Serverless Computing**: A cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates resources as needed to execute code functions. Security considerations include securing function code, managing function permissions and access controls, monitoring function execution for security anomalies, and implementing proper logging and auditing.

**Shared Responsibility Model**: The division of security responsibilities between cloud service providers and customers, which varies depending on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). Understanding and properly implementing shared responsibility is crucial for cloud security, requiring clear documentation of who is responsible for each aspect of security and regular validation that both parties are fulfilling their obligations.

### **T**

**Threat Modeling**: The systematic approach to identifying, understanding, and addressing potential security threats to cloud applications and infrastructure. Cloud threat modeling considers unique cloud threats such as account hijacking, insecure APIs, data breaches in multi-tenant environments, and denial of service attacks against cloud resources.

### **V**

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: A logically isolated section of cloud infrastructure where resources can be launched with customized network configurations. VPC security involves properly configuring network access controls, implementing secure connectivity options, monitoring network traffic, and maintaining proper network segmentation.

**Vulnerability Management**: The process of identifying, evaluating, and addressing security vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications. Cloud vulnerability management includes scanning cloud configurations, assessing container images and serverless functions, monitoring for new vulnerabilities, and coordinating with cloud providers for infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.

### **Z**

**Zero Trust Architecture**: A security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously validates every transaction and access request. In cloud environments, zero trust involves implementing strong identity verification, least privilege access controls, encryption of all communications, continuous monitoring and analytics, and assuming that networks are always compromised.

**Zone Redundancy**: The distribution of cloud resources across multiple availability zones within a region to provide high availability and disaster recovery capabilities. Security considerations include ensuring consistent security controls across zones, implementing secure data replication, maintaining security monitoring across all zones, and coordinating incident response across distributed resources.

### **Cloud Service Context Terms**

**Bastion Host**: A special-purpose server designed to withstand attacks and provide secure access to cloud resources. Bastion hosts typically sit in public subnets and provide controlled access to resources in private subnets, requiring strong authentication, comprehensive logging, and regular security updates.

**Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)**: Security solutions designed specifically for protecting workloads in cloud environments, including virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions. CWPP solutions provide vulnerability management, compliance monitoring, runtime protection, and threat detection tailored to cloud deployment models.

**Immutable Infrastructure**: The practice of never modifying cloud infrastructure once deployed, instead replacing it entirely when changes are needed. This approach improves security by preventing configuration drift, ensuring consistent baselines, simplifying change management, and reducing the attack surface by eliminating persistent access points.

**Micro-segmentation**: A security technique that creates secure zones in cloud networks, allowing organizations to isolate workloads and secure them individually. Micro-segmentation enables granular security policies, reduces lateral movement of threats, improves compliance through detailed access controls, and provides better visibility into network traffic patterns.

**Service Mesh**: A dedicated infrastructure layer that manages service-to-service communication in cloud-native applications, providing security features such as encryption, authentication, and access control. Service mesh security includes mutual TLS between services, fine-grained access policies, traffic encryption, and comprehensive observability of service communications.
