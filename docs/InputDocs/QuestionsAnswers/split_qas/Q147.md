**Standard terms**  
- **Documented information (Cl.7.5):** staff should know where to find records.

Educate on **process objectives** and show them the **document locations**. Conduct mock interviews to build confidence. Emphasize honesty—auditors value transparency over rehearsed answers.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.5

**Why it matters**

- Launch **Interview Preparation** workflow.  
- Assign mock-interview sessions.

**How our platform will help**
