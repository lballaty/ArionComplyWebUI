### 94) Do we need to buy expensive security monitoring tools?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Logging & monitoring (A.12.4):** detect and record events.

**Plain-English answer**  
Cloud services often include logging dashboards; basic log aggregation and alerting can suffice. Dedicated SIEMs are recommended only for large environments or high-security needs.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.12.4

**Why it matters**  
Avoid unnecessary licensing costs while still meeting detection requirements.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Catalog existing **logging capabilities**.  
- Assess gaps against monitoring needs.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Monitoring tool inventory.  
- **[Dashboard]** Event detection status.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “Which open-source SIEMs are viable?”
