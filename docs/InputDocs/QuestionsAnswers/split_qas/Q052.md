### 52) What can we do to become GDPR compliant quickly if we're behind?

**Standard terms)**
- **Processing principles (GDPR Art. 5):** lawfulness, purpose limitation, data minimization.  
- **Security (GDPR Art. 32):** implement basic controls (encryption, access control).  
- **Communications security (ISO 27001 A.6):** protects information in transit.

**Plain-English answer**  
Prioritize a **quick-win** checklist: update privacy notices, map processing (RoPA), enforce MFA, backup critical data, and encrypt records. These address key principles and security obligations.

- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 5; 32  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.6

**Why it matters**
