### 78) How do we manage vendor relationships for compliance?

**Standard term(s**  
- **Supplier relationship (ISO 27001 A.15.1.1):** requirements for vendor selection and management.  
- **Service delivery (ISO 27002 Sect. 15.1):** details on monitoring and reviewing supplier services.

**Plain-English answer**  
Establish a **vendor compliance register** listing all suppliers, embed security requirements in contracts (SLAs, audit rights), perform risk assessments, and schedule periodic reviews. Automate reminders for renewals and evidence collection.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.15.1.1  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Section 15.1

**Why it matters**  
Vendors often introduce third-party risk; structured management prevents supply-chain breaches.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Populate the **Vendor Compliance Register**.  
- Launch **Vendor Onboarding** workflow to enforce requirements.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Pre-built vendor risk and compliance fields.  
- **[Workflow]** Contract clause templates and review tasks.  
- **[Dashboard]** Vendor performance and compliance status.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “What clause templates should we include in contracts?”
