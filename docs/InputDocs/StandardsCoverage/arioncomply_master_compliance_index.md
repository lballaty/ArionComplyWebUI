## Superset Usage
- **Audit Readiness:** Each matrix includes audit/evidence tagging for certification prep.  
- **Overlap Awareness:** Cross-framework overlaps allow efficiency in compliance.  
- **Operationalization:** Mappings support workflow engine, dashboards, AI assistant, and evidence repository in ArionComply.  
- **Extensibility:** Index will evolve with additional frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI DSS).

## Next Steps
1. Develop **visual crosswalk diagrams** for overlaps (heatmaps, swimlanes).
2. Generate an **Audit Readiness Checklist** aligned with all four frameworks.
3. Extend to **sector-specific frameworks** (finance, telecom, health).
