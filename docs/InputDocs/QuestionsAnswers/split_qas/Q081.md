### 81) What documents are part of an ISMS?

**Standard terms**  
- **Documented information (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.5):** mandatory records and policies.  
- **Annex A controls (A.5):** control-specific templates.  
- **PIMS documentation (ISO 27701 Sect. 7.4):** privacy records.

**Plain-English answer**  
Core ISMS docs include: scope statement, Information Security Policy, Statement of Applicability (SoA), Risk Assessment & Treatment Plan, Records of Processing Activities (RoPA), procedures (e.g., incident response), work instructions, and audit records.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 7.5; Annex A.5  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 7.4
