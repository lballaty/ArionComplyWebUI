### 238) How do we coordinate between legal, technical, and business teams during crises?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Roles & responsibilities (Cl.7.2):** define competence and authority.

**Plain-English answer**  
Use a **Crisis Management Playbook** with a RACI matrix—legal approves disclosures, technical leads containment, business handles stakeholder communication. Hold a single war-room meeting with all leads, then spin up parallel action tracks.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.2

**Why it matters**  
Clear roles prevent duplication and overlooked tasks during high-stress incidents.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Invoke **Crisis Coordination** workflow.  
- Share playbook and RACI matrix with all responders.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Simultaneous legal/tech/business task boards.  
- **[Report]** Real-time status across teams.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- How do we escalate to executive leadership?
