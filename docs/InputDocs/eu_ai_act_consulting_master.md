## Section 8: Glossary of Terms and Concepts

*This glossary assumes no prior knowledge of AI regulation or technical concepts. Each term is explained in practical business context with compliance implications.*

### **A**

**AI System**: According to the EU AI Act, a machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers outputs such as predictions, recommendations, or decisions that influence physical or virtual environments. In practical terms, this includes any software that uses algorithms to analyze data and make decisions that would traditionally require human intelligence, such as recommendation engines, fraud detection systems, automated hiring tools, or chatbots.

**Algorithmic Bias**: Systematic prejudice in AI system outputs that unfairly discriminates against certain groups or individuals. This can occur when training data contains historical biases, when certain groups are underrepresented in training data, or when the algorithm itself introduces discriminatory decision-making patterns. For example, a hiring AI system might systematically favor male candidates if trained on historical data from periods when women were underrepresented in certain roles. Under the AI Act, providers must identify and mitigate such biases.

**Artificial Intelligence**: The EU AI Act defines AI based on specific techniques and approaches listed in Annex I, including machine learning, logic and knowledge-based approaches, and statistical approaches. Rather than attempting to define intelligence itself, the regulation focuses on systems that use these specific technical methods to perform tasks that typically require human cognitive abilities, such as learning, reasoning, perceiving, or decision-making.

### **C**

**CE Marking**: A mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the European Economic Area, indicating that the product complies with relevant EU regulations. For high-risk AI systems under the AI Act, CE marking demonstrates that the system has undergone required conformity assessment procedures and meets safety and performance requirements. The CE marking must be visible, legible, and indelible, and allows the AI system to be placed on the EU market.

**Conformity Assessment**: The systematic process of demonstrating that an AI system meets the requirements specified in the AI Act. This involves evaluating the system's design, documentation, and performance against regulatory standards. For most high-risk AI systems, providers conduct this assessment internally, while certain systems require third-party assessment by notified bodies. The process culminates in an EU declaration of conformity and CE marking authorization.

### **D**

**Deployer**: An organization that uses an AI system under its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of personal non-professional activities. Deployers have specific obligations under the AI Act, including conducting fundamental rights impact assessments in certain sectors, monitoring system operation, ensuring human oversight, and maintaining activity logs. For example, a hospital using an AI diagnostic tool would be a deployer, while the company that developed the tool would be the provider.

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn patterns in data. These systems can automatically discover complex patterns and relationships in large datasets without explicit programming. Deep learning powers many AI applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Under the AI Act, deep learning systems may qualify as high-risk depending on their intended purpose and application area.

### **E**

**EU Declaration of Conformity**: A formal document in which the provider declares that their high-risk AI system complies with applicable AI Act requirements. This declaration must contain specific information including system identification, applicable regulations, conformity assessment procedures used, and notified body details if applicable. The declaration enables the provider to affix CE marking and place the system on the EU market.

### **F**

**Foundation Model**: A large AI model that is trained on broad data at scale and is designed for generality of output, and can be adapted to a wide range of distinctive tasks. These models, also called general-purpose AI models (GPAIs) under the AI Act, form the basis for many specific AI applications.

### **R**

**Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification**: The use of AI systems to identify natural persons at a distance in real-time through comparison of biometric data. This typically involves systems like facial recognition cameras in public spaces that immediately identify individuals as they appear. Such systems are generally prohibited under the AI Act, with limited exceptions for law enforcement in specific circumstances and with appropriate safeguards.

**Risk Management System**: A continuous, iterative process throughout the lifecycle of a high-risk AI system that identifies, analyzes, evaluates, and mitigates risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights. The system must consider both individual and societal risks, establish appropriate risk controls, and regularly review and update risk assessments as new information becomes available or system conditions change.

### **S**

**Serious Incident**: Any incident directly or indirectly leading to any of the following: death of a person, serious injury to a person, serious health issue, serious disruption of critical infrastructure operations, or violation of fundamental rights. Providers must report serious incidents to market surveillance authorities within 15 days of becoming aware of them and take appropriate corrective measures to prevent recurrence.

**Systemic Risk**: The potential for a general-purpose AI model with high impact capabilities to cause negative effects at large scale, affect a large number of persons, or cause widespread disruption to critical infrastructure or society. Models exceeding 10²⁵ FLOPs in training computation are presumed to have systemic risk and face additional obligations including model evaluation, adversarial testing, incident reporting, and cybersecurity measures.

### **T**

**Technical Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation that demonstrates how high-risk AI systems comply with AI Act requirements. This includes information about system design and architecture, development methodology, data used for training and testing, risk management measures, performance characteristics, and human oversight procedures.

**Training Data**: The datasets used to teach machine learning algorithms to make predictions or decisions. Under the AI Act, training data for high-risk systems must be relevant, representative, and free from errors and biases that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. Providers must examine datasets for possible biases and implement appropriate mitigation measures, with special attention to ensuring data quality and appropriateness for the intended use.

### **U**

**Unacceptable Risk**: The highest risk level under the AI Act, referring to AI systems that pose such significant threats to safety, livelihood, and rights that they are prohibited entirely. These include systems that use subliminal techniques, exploit vulnerabilities of vulnerable groups, enable social scoring by public authorities, or provide real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces (with limited law enforcement exceptions).

### **AI System Lifecycle Context Terms**

**Adversarial Testing**: A form of security testing where AI systems are deliberately challenged with inputs designed to cause incorrect or harmful outputs. This includes testing for robustness against malicious attacks, edge cases, and unexpected scenarios. For GPAI models with systemic risk, adversarial testing (also called red-teaming) is mandatory to identify potential vulnerabilities and harmful capabilities.

**Bias Mitigation**: The process of identifying and reducing unfair prejudice in AI system outputs through various technical and procedural measures. This may include diversifying training data, adjusting algorithms to account for historical biases, implementing fairness constraints, and ongoing monitoring of system outputs for discriminatory patterns. Bias mitigation is an ongoing requirement throughout the AI system lifecycle.

**Data Governance**: The systematic management of data throughout its lifecycle to ensure quality, security, and compliance with applicable requirements. For AI systems, this includes procedures for data collection, validation, storage, access control, and disposal. Data governance must address both technical data quality issues and legal requirements such as GDPR compliance for personal data used in AI training and operation.

**Model Evaluation**: The systematic assessment of AI model performance, safety, and compliance with regulatory requirements. This includes testing for accuracy, robustness, fairness, and security under various conditions. For high-risk systems and GPAI models, evaluation must be comprehensive and documented, covering both technical performance and potential risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights.

**Transparency**: The principle that AI systems should be understandable and explainable to appropriate stakeholders. This includes providing clear information about system capabilities and limitations, decision-making logic, and potential risks. Transparency requirements vary by risk level, with high-risk systems requiring comprehensive documentation and limited-risk systems requiring clear disclosure of AI use to users.
