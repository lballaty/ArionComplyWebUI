### 98) How do we handle security for remote workers and personal devices?

**Standard terms**  
- **Mobile device controls (A.6.2.3):** requirements for unmanaged devices.  
- **Policy guidance (ISO 27002 6.2.3):** detailed mobile security.

**Plain-English answer**  
Enforce **VPN-only access**, install endpoint protection, require device encryption, and use secure containers for corporate data. Define BYOD policies covering allowable devices and minimum configurations.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.6.2.3  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Section 6.2.3

**Why it matters**  
Protects corporate assets on potentially insecure personal devices.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch **Remote Security Setup** workflow.  
- Generate BYOD policy templates.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Policy]** Draft BYOD and remote-work policies.  
- **[Workflow]** Device onboarding checklists.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “How do we audit BYOD compliance?”
