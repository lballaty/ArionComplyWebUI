### 4) What's NIS2 and do we need to worry about it now?

**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 (Directive 2022/2555):** EU law mandating cybersecurity measures for essential/important entities.
- **Essential entities:** sectors like energy, transport, health (stringent duties).
- **Important entities:** digital services, manufacturing, food.

**Plain-English answer**
NIS2 requires covered organizations to implement risk management, incident reporting, and governance controls. Because it’s a **Directive**, each Member State enacts its own national law, so exact scope and deadlines **vary** **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Directive 2022/2555 Article 2; Annex I
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.1 (governance baseline)

**Why it matters**
Non-compliance can trigger fines, orders, or operational restrictions in regulated sectors.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **sector & size** assessment.
- If in-scope, map your **controls** to NIS2 requirements.
- Configure **incident reporting** workflows for your authority.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Sector/size classification with thresholds.
- **[Tracker]** NIS2 risk register and incident logs.
- **[Workflow]** Reporting templates for national authorities.
- **[Dashboard]** Live NIS2 compliance dashboard.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Which Member State law applies?” (Usually where you’re established **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Does ISO 27001 help?” (Yes—controls overlap significantly)
