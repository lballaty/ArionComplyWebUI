## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of clear desk and clear screen policies like implementing operational security (OpSec) protocols in a military command center.** Just as classified operations require that sensitive documents are secured when not in active use, computer screens are locked when unattended, whiteboards are cleared after briefings, and access codes or passwords are never left visible, business environments must maintain similar discipline to protect organizational information from unauthorized viewing, shoulder surfing, and opportunistic access by unauthorized personnel.

Clear Desk and Clear Screen policies provide **foundational information protection** through simple but critical behavioral controls that prevent the most common and easily exploited information security vulnerabilities in workplace environments.

## 2. Policy Statement

[Organization Name] is committed to implementing clear desk and clear screen practices that protect organizational information from unauthorized access, viewing, and disclosure through simple but effective workplace security behaviors. This policy establishes requirements for securing physical workspaces and computer screens to prevent information exposure and maintain confidentiality of business information and personal data.
