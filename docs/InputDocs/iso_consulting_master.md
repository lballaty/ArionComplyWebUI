## Section 7: Glossary of Terms and Concepts

*This glossary assumes no prior knowledge of information security management or privacy concepts. Each term is explained in practical business context.*

### **A**

**Asset**: Anything that has value to the organization and therefore requires protection. This includes obvious things like computer servers and databases, but also less obvious assets like business processes, employee knowledge, brand reputation, and even the organization's relationships with customers and suppliers. In the context of ISO 27001, assets are typically information assets - any information that the organization needs to operate successfully.

**Availability**: One of the three fundamental principles of information security (along with confidentiality and integrity), referring to ensuring that information and systems are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users. This means having reliable systems, adequate backup procedures, and recovery plans to minimize downtime. For example, if your email system goes down for hours, that's an availability issue even if no data was stolen or corrupted.

### **C**

**Confidentiality**: The principle that information should only be accessible to those authorized to have access. This involves protecting information from unauthorized disclosure, whether intentional (like industrial espionage) or accidental (like sending an email to the wrong person). Confidentiality controls include access restrictions, encryption, physical security, and staff training about handling sensitive information.

**Continual Improvement**: A fundamental principle of ISO management systems requiring organizations to constantly enhance their performance rather than just maintaining the status quo. This involves regularly measuring how well your security and privacy controls are working, identifying areas for enhancement, and implementing improvements. The idea is that threats and business needs constantly evolve, so your security program must evolve too.

**Control**: A measure that reduces risk to an acceptable level. Controls can be technical (like firewalls or encryption), procedural (like security policies or training programs), or physical (like locked doors or security guards). ISO 27001 provides 93 specific controls in Annex A, but organizations choose which ones to implement based on their risk assessment results.

### **D**

**Data Controller**: Under privacy frameworks like GDPR and ISO 27701, the organization that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. Controllers make the key decisions about what personal data to collect, why it's needed, how it will be used, and who it might be shared with. Controllers have primary responsibility for ensuring privacy compliance and face the highest potential penalties for violations.

**Data Processor**: An organization that processes personal data on behalf of and under the instructions of a data controller. Processors act like service providers - they handle the data according to the controller's directions but don't make independent decisions about its use. Examples include cloud hosting providers, payroll companies, or marketing platforms that handle customer data for other businesses.

**Data Subject**: Any living person whose personal data is being processed. This could be employees, customers, website visitors, job applicants, or anyone else whose information an organization handles. Data subjects have specific rights under privacy laws, including the right to know what data is held about them, correct inaccuracies, and in some cases request deletion.

### **I**

**Information Security Management System (ISMS)**: A systematic approach to managing sensitive information through policies, procedures, and controls to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Think of an ISMS as a comprehensive framework that brings together all of an organization's security efforts into a coordinated, documented system that can be measured, monitored, and continuously improved.

**Integrity**: The principle that information should be accurate, complete, and unaltered except by authorized processes. This means protecting information from unauthorized modification, destruction, or corruption. Integrity controls include change management procedures, data validation checks, backup systems, and audit trails that track who modified what information and when.

**Internal Audit**: A systematic, independent examination of the ISMS/PIMS to determine whether it conforms to planned arrangements and is effectively implemented and maintained. Internal audits are conducted by trained personnel from within the organization (or external consultants) who are independent of the area being audited. These audits help identify nonconformities and improvement opportunities before external certification audits.

### **M**

**Management Review**: A formal, periodic evaluation by top management of the ISMS/PIMS to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness. This isn't just a casual check-in - it's a structured review that examines audit results, performance metrics, risk changes, and improvement opportunities. Management review demonstrates leadership commitment and provides direction for the system's evolution.

### **N**

**Nonconformity**: A failure to fulfill a specified requirement of the ISO standard. Nonconformities are identified during internal audits, management reviews, or external certification audits. They must be addressed through corrective action that not only fixes the immediate problem but also identifies and addresses the root cause to prevent recurrence.

### **P**

**Privacy by Design**: The principle of building privacy protection into systems, processes, and business practices from the initial design stage rather than adding it as an afterthought. This proactive approach ensures that privacy considerations are embedded throughout the organization's operations, making compliance more natural and effective while reducing the risk of privacy violations.

**Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)**: An extension of an ISMS that specifically addresses the management of personally identifiable information. A PIMS builds on the foundation of ISO 27001 by adding privacy-specific controls, procedures, and governance structures. Organizations typically implement ISO 27001 first, then extend it with ISO 27701 requirements to create a comprehensive PIMS.

**Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA/DPIA)**: A systematic evaluation of how a proposed project, system, or activity might affect individual privacy. PIAs help identify privacy risks early in the development process when they're easier and less expensive to address. They're required under many privacy regulations (like GDPR's Data Protection Impact Assessments) for high-risk processing activities.

### **R**

**Risk**: The potential for loss, damage, or destruction of an asset as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. Risk is typically calculated by considering both the likelihood that something bad will happen and the impact if it does happen. For example, the risk of a data breach depends on factors like how attractive your data is to attackers, how well it's protected, and what the consequences would be if it was stolen.

**Risk Assessment**: The systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks to information assets. This involves cataloging what information assets you have, identifying what could go wrong with them, determining how likely these problems are, and evaluating what the impact would be. Risk assessment forms the foundation for deciding which security controls to implement.

**Risk Treatment**: The process of selecting and implementing measures to modify risk. The four main risk treatment options are: (1) avoid the risk by not engaging in the risky activity, (2) reduce the risk by implementing controls, (3) transfer the risk through insurance or outsourcing, or (4) accept the risk if it's within tolerance levels. Most organizations use a combination of these approaches.

### **S**

**Scope**: The boundaries and applicability of the ISMS/PIMS, defining what is included and excluded from the management system. Scope definition is critical because it determines what must be protected and assessed. For example, an organization might include all customer-facing systems in scope but exclude internal development environments. The scope must be logical, defensible, and clearly documented.

**Statement of Applicability (SoA)**: A document that lists all 93 controls from ISO 27001 Annex A and indicates whether each control is applicable to the organization and, if so, how it's implemented. The SoA provides justification for why certain controls are excluded and describes the implementation approach for included controls. It serves as a roadmap for control implementation and a reference for auditors.

### **T**

**Threat**: Something that could cause harm to an information asset. Threats can be intentional (like hackers or malicious insiders), accidental (like human error or system failures), or environmental (like fires or floods). Understanding potential threats is essential for risk assessment because you need to know what you're protecting against in order to implement appropriate controls.

**Top Management**: The person or group of people who direct and control the organization at the highest level. In ISO 27001/27701 context, top management has specific responsibilities including demonstrating leadership and commitment, establishing the information security policy, ensuring resource availability, and conducting management reviews. Their visible support is crucial for successful ISMS/PIMS implementation.

### **V**

**Vulnerability**: A weakness in an asset or control that could be exploited by one or more threats. Vulnerabilities can be technical (like unpatched software), procedural (like inadequate training), physical (like unlocked doors), or organizational (like unclear responsibilities). Vulnerability assessment involves systematically identifying these weaknesses so they can be addressed through appropriate controls.

### **Information Security Context Terms**

**Access Control**: The practice of restricting access to information and systems to authorized users only. This involves identification (who are you?), authentication (can you prove it?), authorization (what are you allowed to do?), and accounting (what did you actually do?). Effective access control ensures that people can only access the information they need to do their jobs and nothing more.

**Backup**: Copies of information stored separately from the original to enable recovery if the original is lost, damaged, or destroyed. Effective backup strategies follow the "3-2-1 rule": keep 3 copies of important data, store them on 2 different types of media, and keep 1 copy offsite. Regular testing ensures backups work when needed.

**Business Continuity**: The capability of an organization to continue essential operations during and after a disruptive incident. This involves identifying critical business processes, understanding their dependencies, and establishing procedures to maintain or quickly restore operations. Information security plays a crucial role in business continuity by ensuring that critical information systems remain available or can be quickly recovered.

**Change Management**: The systematic approach to dealing with changes to information systems, processes, or organizational structures. From a security perspective, uncontrolled changes can introduce vulnerabilities or disrupt security controls. Effective change management ensures that security implications are considered before changes are made and that appropriate testing and approval processes are followed.

**Encryption**: The process of converting information into a code to prevent unauthorized access. Even if encrypted data is stolen, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key. Encryption is used to protect data "at rest" (stored on devices or servers) and "in transit" (being transmitted over networks). It's considered one of the most effective technical controls for protecting confidentiality.

**Incident Response**: The systematic approach to handling security incidents such as data breaches, system compromises, or policy violations. An effective incident response plan defines roles and responsibilities, establishes communication procedures, outlines technical response steps, and ensures proper documentation. Quick, coordinated response can significantly reduce the impact of security incidents.

**Information Classification**: The practice of categorizing information based on its sensitivity and the potential impact if it's disclosed, modified, or destroyed without authorization. Common classification levels include Public (no harm if disclosed), Internal (some harm if disclosed inappropriately), Confidential (significant harm if disclosed), and Restricted (severe harm if disclosed). Classification drives the selection of appropriate protection measures.

**Malware**: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. This includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and other harmful programs. Protection against malware typically involves multiple layers including antivirus software, email filtering, network monitoring, user training, and regular software updates.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: A security method that requires users to provide two or more different types of evidence before gaining access to systems. The factors typically include something you know (password), something you have (phone or token), and something you are (fingerprint or face scan). MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

**Penetration Testing**: A simulated cyber attack against a computer system to evaluate its security. Penetration testers (often called "ethical hackers") use the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers but with permission and the goal of identifying vulnerabilities so they can be fixed. Regular penetration testing helps validate the effectiveness of security controls.

**Security Awareness Training**: Educational programs designed to help employees recognize and respond appropriately to security threats. Effective training covers topics like password security, phishing recognition, social engineering, physical security, and incident reporting. Since humans are often the weakest link in security, ongoing awareness training is crucial for reducing risks from insider threats and social engineering attacks.

**Vulnerability Assessment**: The systematic identification, quantification, and prioritization of vulnerabilities in information systems. This involves using automated tools and manual techniques to discover security weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers. Regular vulnerability assessments help organizations maintain a strong security posture by identifying and addressing weaknesses proactively.
