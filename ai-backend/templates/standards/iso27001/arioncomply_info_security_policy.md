## 1. ISMS Policy Statement (ISO 27001 Clause 5.2)

*This section explains what an ISMS is and why your organization is committing to it*

**What is an ISMS?**
An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is like a comprehensive security plan for your organization's information. Just as you might have security systems for your home (locks, alarms, cameras), an ISMS is a systematic approach to securing your business information - whether it's customer data, financial records, trade secrets, or employee information.

**Policy Statement:**
{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} hereby establishes, implements, maintains, and continually improves an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 to systematically manage information security risks and protect our information assets.

**What this means in simple terms:**
- **Establishes**: We're officially creating this security system
- **Implements**: We're putting it into action, not just writing about it
- **Maintains**: We're keeping it running and up-to-date
- **Continually improves**: We're always looking for ways to make it better
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**: This is an international standard (like a recipe) that tells us the best way to protect information
- **Information assets**: Anything valuable containing information - databases, documents, emails, etc.

**Top Management Commitment (ISO 27001 Clause 5.1)**: 
Top management demonstrates leadership and commitment to the ISMS by taking accountability for its effectiveness and ensuring it achieves its intended outcomes in protecting {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s information assets and supporting business objectives.

**What "Top Management Commitment" means:**
- **Top Management**: The people at the very top of your organization (CEO, Board of Directors, etc.)
- **Accountability**: They're personally responsible for making sure the security system works
- **Taking ownership**: If something goes wrong, they can't blame others - they accept responsibility
- **Supporting business objectives**: The security system must help the business succeed, not hinder it

This ISMS Policy provides the foundation for all information security activities and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to information security management excellence.

## 2. Organizational Context (ISO 27001 Clause 4.1)

*This section helps you understand your organization's unique situation and how it affects information security*

### 2.1 Understanding Our Organization

**Why Context Matters:**
Every organization is different. A hospital has different security needs than a retail store. A small family business has different challenges than a multinational corporation. Understanding your specific situation helps you build the right kind of security system.

{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} operates within the following context:

**Organization Type**: {{ORGANIZATION_TYPE}}
*Examples: Private company, public company, government agency, non-profit, partnership*

**Industry Sector**: {{INDUSTRY_SECTOR}}
*Examples: Healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, technology, education*

**Business Model**: {{BUSINESS_MODEL}}
*How your organization makes money or delivers value - examples: selling products, providing services, subscription model, advertising-supported*

**Geographic Presence**: {{GEOGRAPHIC_SCOPE}}
*Where your organization operates - examples: single city, nationwide, international, global*

**Organizational Size**: {{ORGANIZATION_SIZE}}
*How big your organization is - examples: small (1-50 employees), medium (51-500), large (500+)*

### 2.2 External Context Factors

**What are External Context Factors?**
These are things outside your organization that can affect your information security. Think of them as the "weather conditions" your organization operates in.

External factors affecting our ISMS include:

- **Regulatory Environment**: {{REGULATORY_ENVIRONMENT}}
  *Laws and regulations you must follow - examples: GDPR for privacy, HIPAA for healthcare, SOX for public companies*

- **Market Conditions**: {{MARKET_CONDITIONS}}

  *Technology trends affecting your industry - examples: cloud computing adoption, mobile device use, AI integration*

- **Threat Environment**: {{THREAT_ENVIRONMENT}}
  *Types of security threats you face - examples: cybercriminals targeting your industry, nation-state attacks, insider threats*

- **Supplier Ecosystem**: {{SUPPLIER_ECOSYSTEM}}
  *Other organizations you depend on - examples: cloud service providers, software vendors, business partners*

- **Customer Expectations**: {{CUSTOMER_EXPECTATIONS}}
  *What your customers expect regarding security and privacy - examples: data protection guarantees, service availability*

### 2.3 Internal Context Factors

**What are Internal Context Factors?**
These are characteristics of your own organization that affect how you approach information security.

Internal factors influencing our ISMS include:

- **Organizational Culture**: {{ORGANIZATIONAL_CULTURE}}
  *How people in your organization think and behave - examples: risk-averse, innovative, collaborative, hierarchical*

- **Financial Resources**: {{FINANCIAL_RESOURCES}}
  *Your budget and financial constraints - examples: limited budget, growing investment in security, cost-conscious*

### 2.4 Context Monitoring

**Why Monitor Context?**
Your organizational context changes over time. New laws are passed, technology evolves, threats change, and your business grows or shifts direction. You need to keep track of these changes to ensure your security system remains effective.

We establish processes to monitor and review these context factors:

- **Review Frequency**: {{CONTEXT_REVIEW_FREQUENCY}}
  *How often we check for changes - examples: quarterly, annually, triggered by major events*

- **Monitoring Methods**: {{CONTEXT_MONITORING_METHODS}}
  *How we track changes - examples: industry reports, news monitoring, stakeholder feedback, performance metrics*

- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of context changes on ISMS effectiveness
  *When something changes, we evaluate whether it affects our security system and how*

- **Adaptation Process**: Systematic adaptation of ISMS to context changes
  *How we modify our security system when the context changes*

## 3. Interested Parties and Their Requirements (ISO 27001 Clause 4.2)

*This section identifies everyone who cares about your information security and what they expect*

### 3.1 Interested Parties Identification

**What are Interested Parties?**
Interested parties (also called stakeholders) are people or organizations who can affect or are affected by your information security. Think of them as everyone who has a stake in whether your information security succeeds or fails.

We have identified the following interested parties relevant to our ISMS:

| Interested Party | Information Security Expectations | Requirements Source |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Customers** | {{CUSTOMER_EXPECTATIONS}} | {{CUSTOMER_REQUIREMENTS_SOURCE}} |

| **Shareholders** | {{SHAREHOLDER_EXPECTATIONS}} | {{SHAREHOLDER_REQUIREMENTS_SOURCE}} |
| **Management** | {{MANAGEMENT_EXPECTATIONS}} | {{MANAGEMENT_REQUIREMENTS_SOURCE}} |

**Examples of Expectations by Interested Party:**

**Customers might expect:**
- Their personal information to be kept private
- Services to be available when needed
- Notification if their data is compromised

### 3.2 Requirements Analysis

**What is Requirements Analysis?**
This means figuring out exactly what each interested party needs from your information security system and why.

For each interested party, we analyze:

- **Specific Information Security Needs**: {{SPECIFIC_NEEDS_ANALYSIS}}
  *What exactly do they need? Examples: 99.9% system availability, encryption of personal data, 24-hour incident response*

- **Regulatory Requirements**: {{REGULATORY_REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS}}
  *What laws or regulations create these requirements? Examples: GDPR requires data breach notification within 72 hours*

- **Contractual Obligations**: {{CONTRACTUAL_OBLIGATIONS_ANALYSIS}}
  *What have you promised in contracts? Examples: service level agreements, security certifications, audit rights*

- **Expectations Management**: {{EXPECTATIONS_MANAGEMENT_APPROACH}}
  *How do you communicate with stakeholders about what you can and cannot provide?*

### 3.3 Requirements Monitoring

**Why Monitor Requirements?**
Requirements change over time. New laws are passed, customer expectations evolve, and business relationships change. You need to stay on top of these changes.

- **Change Monitoring**: Regular assessment of changing requirements
  *How we track when stakeholder requirements change*

- **Communication Channels**: Established channels for requirement communication
  *How stakeholders can tell us about new or changed requirements*

- **Conflict Resolution**: Process for resolving conflicting requirements
  *What happens when different stakeholders want incompatible things*

- **Requirement Updates**: Integration of new requirements into ISMS
  *How we modify our security system when requirements change*

---

## 4. ISMS Scope (ISO 27001 Clause 4.3)

*This section defines exactly what your information security management system covers*

### 4.1 Scope Determination

**What is ISMS Scope?**
The scope defines the boundaries of your information security management system. It's like drawing a line around exactly what parts of your organization the security system applies to. You can't protect everything with the same level of intensity, so you need to be clear about what's included and what's not.

**Why Define Scope?**
- **Focus Resources**: You can concentrate your security efforts where they matter most
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Everyone knows what they're responsible for
- **Audit Clarity**: Auditors know exactly what to examine
- **Risk Management**: You can properly assess and manage risks within defined boundaries

The scope of our ISMS has been determined considering:

- **Physical Boundaries**: {{PHYSICAL_BOUNDARIES}}
  *Which buildings, offices, or locations are included? Examples: headquarters only, all offices, specific data centers*

- **Organizational Boundaries**: {{ORGANIZATIONAL_BOUNDARIES}}
  *Which parts of the organization are included? Examples: entire company, specific divisions, certain departments*

- **Technological Boundaries**: {{TECHNOLOGICAL_BOUNDARIES}}
  *Which technology systems are included? Examples: all IT systems, specific applications, cloud services*

- **Business Process Boundaries**: {{PROCESS_BOUNDARIES}}
  *Which business processes are included? Examples: customer data processing, financial reporting, product development*

### 4.2 ISMS Scope Statement

**Our ISMS Scope Covers**:
{{ISMS_SCOPE_STATEMENT}}

*This should be a clear, simple statement that anyone can understand. Example: "This ISMS covers all information systems and business processes involved in customer order processing and fulfillment at our headquarters and main distribution center."*

**Specifically Included**:
- Business units: {{INCLUDED_BUSINESS_UNITS}}
  *Which departments or divisions - examples: Sales, Customer Service, IT, Finance*

- Locations: {{INCLUDED_LOCATIONS}}
  *Which physical locations - examples: Main office at 123 Main St, Data center in Building B*

- Information systems: {{INCLUDED_SYSTEMS}}
  *Which technology systems - examples: Customer database, Email system, Website, Accounting software*

- Business processes: {{INCLUDED_PROCESSES}}
  *Which business activities - examples: Order processing, Customer support, Employee onboarding*

- Information types: {{INCLUDED_INFORMATION_TYPES}}
  *What kinds of information - examples: Customer personal data, Financial records, Employee information*

### 4.3 Scope Exclusions

**What are Scope Exclusions?**
These are parts of your organization that you've decided NOT to include in your ISMS. This is perfectly normal and acceptable, but you need to be clear about what's excluded and why.

**Excluded from ISMS Scope**:
{{SCOPE_EXCLUSIONS}}

*Examples might include: R&D department (separate security requirements), subsidiary companies (have their own ISMS), legacy systems (being decommissioned)*

**Justification for Exclusions**:
{{EXCLUSION_JUSTIFICATIONS}}

*You need valid reasons for exclusions. Examples: "R&D excluded because it has separate, higher security requirements due to intellectual property sensitivity" or "Legacy system excluded because it's being decommissioned within 6 months"*

### 4.4 Scope Boundaries

**What are Scope Boundaries?**
These are the "edges" of your ISMS - where your controlled environment meets areas that aren't controlled by your ISMS.

- **Interface Management**: How excluded areas interface with ISMS scope
  *How do areas inside and outside your scope interact? Example: How does data flow between your ISMS-covered customer database and an excluded research system?*

- **Dependency Management**: Management of dependencies across scope boundaries
  *What happens when systems inside your scope depend on systems outside it?*

- **Risk Management**: Treatment of risks at scope boundaries
  *How do you handle security risks that cross the boundary?*

- **Communication**: Communication requirements across boundaries
  *How do you coordinate security between areas inside and outside your scope?*

### 4.5 Scope Maintenance

**Why Maintain Scope?**
Your organization changes over time. You might acquire new companies, start new business lines, implement new technology, or change business processes. Your ISMS scope needs to evolve with these changes.

- **Review Triggers**: Events that trigger scope review
  *What changes require you to reconsider your scope? Examples: acquisitions, new products, major technology changes*

- **Change Process**: Process for scope modifications
  *How do you formally change your scope? Who approves changes?*

- **Impact Assessment**: Assessment of scope changes on ISMS effectiveness
  *When you change scope, how do you evaluate the impact on your security system?*

- **Stakeholder Communication**: Communication of scope changes to interested parties
  *How do you tell affected people about scope changes?*

Policies are organized in levels, like a pyramid. Higher-level policies provide broad direction, while lower-level policies provide specific details. This ISMS Policy is at the top of the pyramid.

This ISMS Policy establishes the framework for:

**Level 1 - ISMS Foundation** *(The Foundation - Broadest Policies)*:
- ISMS Policy (this document) - *The overall framework for everything*
- ISMS Scope Definition - *What's covered by the security system*
- Risk Management Policy - *How you approach security risks*

**Level 2 - Core Policies** *(Core Areas - More Specific)*:
- Information Security Policy - *General information security requirements*
- Access Control Policy - *Who can access what information*
- Incident Response Policy - *How to handle security incidents*
- Business Continuity Policy - *How to maintain operations during disruptions*

**Level 3 - Operational Procedures** *(Day-to-Day Operations - Most Specific)*:
- Risk Assessment Procedure - *Step-by-step risk assessment process*
- Access Management Procedure - *Detailed steps for managing access*
- Incident Response Procedure - *Detailed incident handling steps*
- Monitoring and Review Procedures - *How to monitor and review security*

### 8.2 Policy Characteristics

**What Makes a Good ISMS Policy?**
All ISMS policies should have certain characteristics to be effective:

All ISMS policies shall be:

**Appropriate**: Suitable for the purpose and context of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}
*The policy must fit your organization's size, industry, and situation*

*The policy must show you're committed to meeting legal and regulatory requirements*

**Framework Provision**: Provides framework for setting information security objectives
*The policy must provide a structure for setting specific security goals*

**Review Commitment**: Includes commitment to continual improvement
*The policy must show you're committed to making the security system better over time*

### 8.3 Policy Availability

**Why Make Policies Available?**
Policies only work if people can access them and understand them. You also need to make relevant parts available to external stakeholders when appropriate.

This policy and supporting policies are:

- **Made Available**: To relevant interested parties as appropriate
  *People who need to know about the policy can access it*

- **Communicated**: Within the organization through established channels
  *Information about the policy is actively shared, not just posted somewhere*

- **Maintained**: As documented information with proper version control
  *The policy is kept up-to-date and you can track changes over time*

- **Accessible**: Through {{POLICY_ACCESS_METHODS}}
  *How people can actually get access to the policy - examples: company intranet, policy management system, printed copies*
