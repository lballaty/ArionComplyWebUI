### 185) What if our cloud provider has a data breach — are we liable too?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Incident management (ISO27001 A.16.1.4):** roles/responsibilities for incidents.  
- **Compensation (GDPR Art.82):** data subjects can claim damages.

**Plain-English answer**  
You and your provider share liability: if you mis-configured controls or breached data-protection clauses, you’re also at fault. Check your contract’s indemnity clauses and ensure your incident-response plan covers both parties.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.16.1.4; GDPR Article 82

**Why it matters**  
Protects against unexpected legal and financial risk.

**Do next in our platform**  
1. Log the breach in the **Breach Log**.  
2. Run the **Breach Response** workflow to assess provider vs customer fault.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Tracker]** Assigns blame-matrix and timelines.  
- **[Report]** Calculates potential fines and claims.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- How do we negotiate indemnification?  
- Can we suspend the provider immediately?
