### 163) Can we rely on our cloud provider to handle international compliance for us?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Outsourced development (ISO 27001 A.14.2.7):** control objectives for third-party platforms.  
- **Processor (GDPR Art. 28):** cloud provider processes data on your behalf; you remain controller.

**Plain-English answer**  
No. Cloud vendors protect the **infrastructure**, but **you** must configure security, apply SCCs or adequacy, and document transfers. Think “shared responsibility”: provider → physical/virtual host; you → data, identity, and legal basis.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A 14.2.7; GDPR Article 28

**Why it matters**  
Misunderstanding roles leaves gaps auditors will flag.

**Do next in our platform**  
1. Fill out the **Shared-Responsibility Matrix**.  
2. Verify cloud certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2).  
3. Attach SCCs for non-EEA regions.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Pre-built matrix for AWS, Azure, GCP.  
- **[Report]** Gaps where customer actions are pending.  
- **[Dashboard]** Real-time compliance status by region/service.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- Do we need to encrypt before upload?  
- Which regions meet EU data-residency needs?
