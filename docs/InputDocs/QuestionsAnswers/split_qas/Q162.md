### 162) What is an adequacy decision and how do we know if a country has one?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Adequacy decision (GDPR Art. 45):** the EU formally judges a non-EEA country’s data-protection laws “essentially equivalent” to the GDPR.

**Plain-English answer**  
If a destination country is on the EU’s adequacy list (e.g., Japan, UK, Canada commercial sector), you can transfer EU personal data there **without SCCs or extra paperwork**. The European Commission publishes and updates the list on its website.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 45

**Why it matters**  
Adequacy status simplifies compliance and speeds up business expansion.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Consult the auto-synced **Adequacy Register**.  
- Tag any new transfer destinations; the platform alerts you if adequacy changes.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Live adequacy list with effective dates.  
- **[Dashboard]** Map showing data flows by adequacy status.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- What happens if adequacy is **revoked**?  
- Which territories are “partial” (e.g., commercial only)?
