### 77) What is an Information Security Management System and how do we build one?

**Standard terms**  
- **Context & requirements (ISO 27001 Cl. 4):** defines ISMS scope.  
- **ISMS definition (ISO 27000 Cl. 3):** systematic approach to security.

**Plain-English answer**  
An ISMS is a **structured framework** of policies, processes, and controls designed to manage and mitigate information-security risks. You build it by defining scope, conducting risk assessments, selecting controls, documenting procedures, and continuously reviewing.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27000:2018 Clause 3
