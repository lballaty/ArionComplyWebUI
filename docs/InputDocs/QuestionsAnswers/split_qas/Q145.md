### 145) Should we do a "pre-audit" or practice audit before the real one?

**Standard terms**  
- **Internal audit (ISO 27001 Cl.9.2):** serves as a practice for certification audits.

**Plain-English answer**  
Absolutely—an internal “pre-audit” identifies gaps and gives teams practice with audit processes. It’s the best way to reduce major findings and nerves during the real audit.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 9.2

**Why it matters**  
Early detection of issues saves time and cost of corrective actions post-certification audit.
