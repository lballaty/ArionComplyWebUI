### 1) What is ISO 27001 and why does everyone keep talking about it?

**Standard terms)**
- **ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 4.1):** a structured system of policies, processes, controls, and roles to manage information-security risks.
- **Annex A controls (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5):** specific security measures (e.g., access control, asset management).

**Plain-English answer**
ISO 27001 is the global benchmark for building an **Information Security Management System** (ISMS). It guides you through defining your security scope, assessing risks, selecting controls, assigning responsibilities, and continuously improving. Many customers and partners ask for ISO 27001 certification because it’s an **auditable, recognized proof** of your security maturity.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.1; Annex A.5
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Section 1.1; ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5.1

**Why it matters**
Certification provides a **single source of truth**—customers trust your security without needing their own audit.

**Do next in our platform**
- Define your **ISMS scope** using the Context Wizard.
- Populate the **risk register** and link risks to controls.
- Generate your **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** baseline.
- Upload existing policies and assign control owners.

**How our platform will help**
- **[NL-Portal]** Navigate directly to ISMS setup screens.
- **[Register]** Pre-structured risk and asset registers with ISO mappings.
- **[Draft Doc]** Auto-generate policies and SoA from templates.
- **[Workflow]** Guided ISMS implementation with task assignments.
- **[Dashboard]** Track implementation progress and control coverage.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What exactly is an ISMS?” (See Q010.)
- “Which controls are in Annex A?” (See Q025.)
- “How long and how much does certification cost?” (See Q051.)

### 2) What's the difference between a "standard" and a "regulation" and why does it matter?

**Standard terms)**
- **Standard (ISO/IEC 27001 Section 1):** voluntary guidance developed by expert consensus; you choose to adopt it or customers may require it.
- **Regulation (GDPR Article 2):** binding law with enforcement powers; authorities can fine for non-compliance.
- **Directive:** EU law requiring Member State transposition (e.g., NIS2).

**Plain-English answer**
A standard like ISO 27001 is **voluntary**—you can get certified to demonstrate compliance. A regulation like GDPR is **law**—you **must** comply. You **certify** to standards; you **comply** with regulations. Knowing the difference helps you prioritize what’s legally required versus what’s commercially valuable.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Section 1.1; GDPR Article 2
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** EU AI Act Article 1; NIS2 Article 1

**Why it matters**
Understanding what's optional versus legally required changes your implementation priorities and risk assessment.

**Do next in our platform**
- Tag each requirement as **Standard** or **Regulation** in your compliance register.
- Build separate roadmaps for legal obligations versus voluntary certifications.
- Set up monitoring for regulatory deadlines and updates.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Legal & regulatory compliance tracking with auto-categorization.
- **[Planner]** Separate planning streams for standards vs regulations.
- **[Dashboard]** Visual distinction between legal requirements and voluntary standards.
- **[NL-Portal]** Jump to relevant compliance areas instantly.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “If NIS2 is a Directive, what do we follow today?” (Your Member State’s law **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Can ISO 27001 certification help with GDPR compliance?” (Yes—many controls overlap)

### 3) Is GDPR just a European thing or does it affect my US/non-EU company too?

**Standard terms)**
- **Territorial scope (GDPR Article 3):** applies to non-EU companies offering goods/services to, or monitoring, EU individuals.
- **Offering goods/services:** targeting EU market (e.g., pricing, localized marketing).
- **Monitoring behavior:** tracking EU individuals’ activities (e.g., analytics, profiling).

**Plain-English answer**
GDPR applies to non-EU companies when they **offer goods or services** to EU individuals or **monitor** their behavior. Just having a publicly accessible website **is not enough**, but actively marketing to or tracking EU visitors **triggers** GDPR duties **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 3
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** CPRA Section 1798.140

**Why it matters**
Misunderstanding scope leads to unexpected obligations or wasted effort on out-of-scope scenarios.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **Territorial Scope** wizard.
- If in-scope, build your **RoPA** and tag processing activities.
- Map data subjects and purposes to confirm coverage.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Workflow]** Guided scope decision tree.
- **[Register]** Data processing map with in/out flags.
- **[Classify-Assist]** Auto-tag high-risk activities.
- **[Dashboard]** Live scope status report.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What if we only have EU employees but no customers?” (Still in-scope for employee data)
- “Do we need an EU representative?” (Art. 27—if no EU establishment **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)

### 4) What's NIS2 and do we need to worry about it now?

**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 (Directive 2022/2555):** EU law mandating cybersecurity measures for essential/important entities.
- **Essential entities:** sectors like energy, transport, health (stringent duties).
- **Important entities:** digital services, manufacturing, food (lighter duties).

**Plain-English answer**
NIS2 requires covered organizations to implement risk management, incident reporting, and governance controls. Because it’s a **Directive**, each Member State enacts its own national law, so exact scope and deadlines **vary** **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Directive 2022/2555 Article 2; Annex I
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.1 (governance baseline)

**Why it matters**
Non-compliance can trigger fines, orders, or operational restrictions in regulated sectors.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **sector & size** assessment.
- If in-scope, map your **controls** to NIS2 requirements.
- Configure **incident reporting** workflows for your authority.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Sector/size classification with thresholds.
- **[Tracker]** NIS2 risk register and incident logs.
- **[Workflow]** Reporting templates for national authorities.
- **[Dashboard]** Live NIS2 compliance dashboard.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Which Member State law applies?” (Usually where you’re established **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Does ISO 27001 help?” (Yes—controls overlap significantly)

**Sources**
- NIS2 Directive 2022/2555 Article 2; Annex I–II

### 5) What is the EU AI Act and when do we need to comply?

**Standard terms)**
- **High-risk AI (EU AI Act Annex III):** categories of AI (e.g., biometric, critical infrastructure) subject to strict rules.
- **Obligations (EU AI Act Art. 6):** requirements for governance, data quality, transparency, and human oversight.

**Plain-English answer**
The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk. **High-risk** systems must meet governance, quality, transparency, and oversight rules starting at different dates (e.g., 24 months post-entry into force). Lower-risk systems have lighter duties (transparency disclosures). Check when your category’s deadlines begin **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** EU AI Act Art. 6; Annex III
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** GDPR Art. 22 (automated decisions); ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.18 (privacy in design)

**Why it matters**
Missing deadlines can lead to fines and a halt on putting AI into service.

**Do next in our platform**
- Classify each AI system by risk category.
- Map obligations (Art. 6) to controls and policies.
- Schedule compliance milestones by risk-category timeline.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Classify-Assist]** AI risk-category wizard.
- **[Register]** AI inventory with risk tags.
- **[Tracker]** Obligations and deadlines.
- **[Workflow]** Governance & documentation processes.
- **[Dashboard]** Live AI Act compliance view.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “When do lower-risk AI duties start?” (Depends on system type **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Do transparency logs satisfy GDPR Art. 22?” (Often yes—map together)

### 6) What does “getting certified” actually mean and what do I get at the end?

**Standard terms)**
- **Certification Body (ISO/IEC 17021-1):** an accredited body that audits your ISMS against ISO 27001 and issues a certificate.
- **Certificate scope (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A):** the listed organizational units, processes, and controls covered by the audit.

**Plain-English answer**
Getting certified means an **accredited CB** reviews your ISMS documentation and evidence, conducts **Stage 1** (readiness) and **Stage 2** (implementation) audits, and—if you pass—issues a certificate valid for **three years**, with **annual surveillance**. The certificate lists your **scope** (what was audited).

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1; ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** IAF MD 5 (audit time guidance) **[CB POLICY VARIES]**

**Why it matters**
A certificate is **third-party proof** of your security program, often required by customers.

**Do next in our platform**
- Plan your **audit readiness**: schedule internal audits and reviews.
- Build an **evidence pack** mapped to clauses/controls.
- Book your CB and align on scope.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Planner]** Audit calendar and reminders.

### 7) Are these compliance things optional or will I get in legal trouble if I ignore them?

**Standard terms)**
- **Regulation (GDPR Art. 83; CPRA §1798.155; NIS2 Arts. 34–36):** mandatory legal requirements with enforcement powers.
- **Standard (ISO 27001, 27701):** voluntary frameworks you can certify against.

**Plain-English answer**
Standards are **optional**—they’re best practices you can certify to. Regulations are **law**—if you’re in scope, non-compliance can lead to **fines**, **orders**, or **other sanctions**. Ignoring laws like GDPR, CPRA, or NIS2 can get you in legal trouble; ignoring ISO standards may hurt sales.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 83; NIS2 Articles 34–36
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** CPRA Section 1798.155

**Why it matters**
Distinguish what you **must** do (laws) versus what you **should** do (standards) to allocate resources properly.

**Do next in our platform**
- Map your **mandatory duties** in the legal obligations register.
- Prioritize **legal requirements** over voluntary certifications.
- Build a **priority plan** for high-risk legal gaps.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Law vs standard matrix.
- **[Workflow]** Priority plan builder.
- **[Dashboard]** Compliance risk/penalty heatmap.
- **[Report]** Export enforcement-risk summaries.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What are our expected fines/exposure?” (**[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Do we need to certify to ISO to satisfy laws?” (No—laws stand alone, but ISO helps with evidence.)

### 8) What’s the difference between being “compliant” and being “certified”?

**Standard terms)**
- **Certified:** an accredited CB has audited you against a **standard** (e.g., ISO 27001) and issued a certificate.
- **Compliant:** you meet legal or policy requirements (e.g., GDPR), with or without certification.
- **GDPR schemes (Arts. 42–43):** voluntary certification frameworks, not legal safe harbors.

**Plain-English answer**
“Certified” means a third party has **audited** you against a standard and granted a certificate. “Compliant” means you **meet** legal or contractual requirements, which can include standards but don’t depend on a certificate. Laws like GDPR don’t have universal CB certification; some schemes exist but don’t replace legal duties.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1; GDPR Articles 42–43
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022

**Why it matters**
Customers often ask for **certification** to standards; regulators look for **compliance** with laws.

**Do next in our platform**
- Review your **certification roadmap** separately from your **legal compliance** plan.
- Track **certification milestones** and **legal duties** in different registers.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Dual-track compliance vs certification.
- **[Workflow]** Parallel roadmaps.
- **[Report]** Export cert status vs legal status summaries.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Are GDPR certification schemes worth it?” (They can help assurance but don’t replace legal compliance.)

### 9) Why are there so many different standards and regulations—can’t I just do one?

**Standard terms)**
- **Management System (ISO 27001 Scope):** baseline framework.
- **Privacy Extension (ISO 27701):** adds PII governance to the ISMS.
- **Accountability (GDPR Art. 24):** legal overlay requiring proof of measures.

**Plain-English answer**
Each framework serves a purpose: ISO 27001/27701 give you a **system** to run security and privacy. GDPR/CPRA/NIS2/EU AI Act set **legal rules** you must follow. By **cross-mapping** once, you can reuse controls and evidence across all.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Scope; GDPR Art. 24

**Why it matters**

### 10) What is a Data Protection Officer and do I need to hire one?

**Standard terms)**
- **DPO (GDPR Arts. 37–39):** person designated to advise, monitor compliance, and liaise with authorities.
- **Privacy roles (ISO/IEC 27701 Section 5):** defines PII governance responsibilities.

**Plain-English answer**
Under GDPR, a **DPO** is required if you do large-scale special-category data processing or systematic monitoring. They can be internal or external and must report independently. If you don’t need a DPO, assign a **privacy officer** to cover core duties.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 37–39
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5

**Why it matters**
Incorrect DPO designation can incur regulator scrutiny or conflicts of interest.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **DPO checklist**.
- If required, draft and **approve** DPO appointment.
- Otherwise, assign privacy responsibilities to a **privacy officer**.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** DPO/Privacy Officer register.
- **[Draft Doc]** Appointment letters & charters.
- **[Approval]** E-sign and track.
- **[Workflow]** Ongoing DPO tasks.
- **[Versioning]** Role history and changes.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Can our CISO or counsel be DPO?” (Watch for conflicts **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)

### 11) What does “personal data” actually include—is it just names and emails?

**Standard terms)**
- **Personal data (GDPR Art. 4(1))**: any information relating to an identified or identifiable person.
- **Personal information (CPRA §1798.140)**: info that identifies, relates to, or can be linked to a California consumer.
- **PII categories (ISO/IEC 27701 Section 6):** taxonomy of personal and special-category data.

**Plain-English answer**
It’s broader than names/emails. IDs, IP addresses, location, biometric data, photos, voice recordings, and any combination that can identify someone **indirectly** count.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 4(1); CPRA §1798.140
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 6

**Why it matters**
Correctly spotting personal data drives your notices, security controls, and rights management.

**Do next in our platform**
- Launch the **Data Classification** wizard.
- Tag assets as **personal** vs **non-personal**.
- Flag **special categories** (health, biometrics).

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Data inventory register.
- **[Classify-Assist]** Auto-suggest PII flags.
- **[Workflow]** Special-category review.
- **[Report]** PII summary for audits.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Is pseudonymized data still personal?” → Yes—if re-identification is possible.

### 12) What is an “information security management system” and is it software I need to buy?

**Standard terms)**
- **ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001 Clauses 4–10):** a management framework of policies, processes, controls, and records—not a specific software product.
- **PIMS (ISO/IEC 27701 Clauses 4–6):** extends ISMS for privacy management.

**Plain-English answer**
An ISMS is **how** you run security as an ongoing program—defining scope, assessing risk, implementing controls, and improving. You don’t “install” an ISMS; you **operate** it. Software helps manage registers, workflows, and evidence, but the ISMS is **people + processes + records**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 4–10
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clauses 4–6

**Why it matters**
Auditors certify your **system of work**, not just a tool.

**Do next in our platform**
- Generate core **ISMS artifacts**: scope statement, risk register, SoA, policies.
- Schedule **internal audits** and **management reviews**.
- Link artifacts to controls and evidence.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Draft Doc]** Artifact templates.
- **[Versioning]** Document history & rollback.
- **[Approval]** E-sign and publish.
- **[Register]** Central artifact registry.
- **[Planner]** Audit & review calendar.

### 13) How do I know if my company needs to comply with GDPR?

**Standard terms)**
- **Territorial scope (GDPR Article 3):** applies if you’re offering goods/services to, or monitoring, EU individuals; or have an EU establishment.
- **Security (GDPR Art. 32):** applies to all in-scope processing.

**Plain-English answer**
You’re in-scope if you **target** EU/EEA individuals (e.g., local marketing, pricing, shipping) or **monitor** them (analytics, profiling). If all processing happens entirely outside the EU and you don’t target EU individuals, GDPR likely does not apply.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 3
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.18 (security baseline)

**Why it matters**
Scope determines whether you must do notices, rights handling, breach reporting, etc.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **GDPR Scope Check** wizard.
- If in-scope, create your **RoPA** and tag systems.
- Start required workstreams (notices, DSARs, security).

**How our platform will help**
- **[Workflow]** Automated scope assessment.
- **[Register]** Processing inventory.
- **[Report]** Scope vs non-scope summary.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Do we need an EU representative?” (Art. 27—if no EU HQ)
- “Do we need a DPO?” (See Q010)

### 14) What makes a company “essential” under NIS2 — are we big enough to worry?

**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 scope (Art. 2–3):** applies to medium+ entities in Annex I sectors; some small entities may be included.
- **Essential entities (Annex I):** energy, transport, health, digital infrastructure.
- **Important entities (Annex II):** digital services, manufacturing, food.

**Plain-English answer**
NIS2 covers **medium** and **large** organizations in critical sectors listed in Annex I. Annex II covers “important” but less critical services. Very small players generally fall outside, but Member States can tweak thresholds **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Article 2; Article 3; Annex I
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3

**Why it matters**
Being in-scope triggers mandatory risk management, incident reporting, and governance duties.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **Sector & Size** wizard.
- If in-scope, map controls to NIS2 obligations.
- Enable incident reporting workflows.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Sector and size classification.
- **[Tracker]** NIS2 risk register and incident logs.
- **[Workflow]** Authority reporting processes.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Which national law applies?” (Where you’re established **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Can ISO 27001 satisfy parts of NIS2?” (Yes—governance controls overlap)

**Sources**

### 15) We’re a small business with 20 employees — do we really need ISO 27001?

**Standard terms)**
- **ISO Certification:** voluntary; customers may ask for it.
- **Security of processing (GDPR Art. 32):** still applies if you handle personal data.

**Plain-English answer**
ISO 27001 is not legally mandatory; small firms often adopt it to **win deals** and **structure** security. If customers don’t require certification, you can still run ISMS practices without getting the certificate.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 4–10
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** GDPR Article 32

**Why it matters**
Certification can accelerate sales, but building the ISMS itself drives real security benefits.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run a **Gap Analysis**.
- Decide on **certification vs internal** ISMS only.
- Stand up core artifacts (risk, SoA, policies).

**How our platform will help**

### 16) We only operate in one country — why are people talking about international regulations?

**Standard terms)**
- **Territorial scope (GDPR Art. 3):** applies based on customer/subject location.
- **Transfers (GDPR Arts. 44–49):** rules for moving data across borders.

**Plain-English answer**
Even if you’re local, your **customers**, **vendors**, or **cloud regions** might be international. If you **target** EU individuals or your data **leaves** the EU, GDPR applies. Contracts often bring in other jurisdictions too.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 3; 44–49
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** none

**Why it matters**
Hidden cross-border flows create duties—notice, transfer mechanisms, and records.

**Do next in our platform**
- Map **where** data is stored/processed.
- Check **GDPR applicability** & transfer needs.
- Add transfer mechanisms to your **register**.

**How our platform will help**

### 17) What if we just use cloud services like Office 365 and Salesforce — does compliance still apply?

**Standard terms)**
- **Controller vs Processor (GDPR Arts. 4,28):** you remain controller; cloud is processor.
- **Security (GDPR Art. 32):** you must ensure appropriate measures.
- **Transfers (GDPR Arts. 44–46):** apply if data moves outside the EU.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes. Cloud providers don’t relieve your duties. You must choose providers with **sufficient guarantees**, sign a **DPA**, configure security controls, and manage data-transfer mechanisms as needed.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 28, 32; 44–46
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.15

**Why it matters**
Assuming the cloud covers everything leads to compliance gaps.

**Do next in our platform**

- **Business definition (CPRA §1798.140):** for-profit entities meeting thresholds; nonprofits often exempt.
- **Privacy roles (ISO/IEC 27701 5.2):** defines governance over PII.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes. GDPR covers personal data of **employees** and **business contacts**. CPRA may apply if you meet thresholds—even if B2B. PII governance best practices (ISO 27701) still guide you.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 4(1); CPRA §1798.140
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5.2

**Why it matters**
Ignoring employee/contact data creates compliance gaps and risks.

### 19) We’re a subsidiary of a larger company — who’s responsible for compliance?

**Standard terms)**
- **Controller (GDPR Art. 4(7)):** entity determining purposes/means of processing.
- **Joint controllers (Art. 26):** share decisions and must have an arrangement.
- **Processor (Art. 28):** processes on another’s instructions.

**Plain-English answer**
Each legal entity is responsible for its own processing. If HQ decides purposes/means, they’re a **controller** (possibly joint). If the subsidiary acts on HQ’s instructions, it’s a **processor** unless you share control decisions.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 4(7), 26, 28
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5

**Why it matters**
Misclassifying roles causes contract and audit issues.

**Do next in our platform**
- Map roles for each processing activity.
- Draft or update **joint-controller** arrangements or **DPAs**.
- Update your RoPA with correct roles.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Role-mapping register.
- **[Draft Doc]** Joint-controller and DPA templates.
- **[Approval]** E-sign agreements.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Do we need a group data-sharing agreement?” (Often yes)

### 20) We’re a startup — when do we need to start worrying about this stuff?

**Standard terms)**
- **Accountability (GDPR Art. 24):** you must implement appropriate measures from first processing.
- **Context & planning (ISO/IEC 27001 Clauses 4–6):** set scope, objectives, and risk criteria early.

**Plain-English answer**
From **day one**, when you handle any personal data, you’re accountable for security and privacy. Start small—inventory data, publish basic notices, enforce MFA, and set up backups and a simple risk process. Scale your ISMS as you grow.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 24; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 4–6
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 4

**Why it matters**
Early habits are cheaper and more effective than late retrofitting.

**Do next in our platform**
- Use the **MVP Program** template to stand up core artifacts.
- Assign owners and set a quarterly review cadence.
- Link initial risk findings to simple controls.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Draft Doc]** MVP policy & process templates.
- **[Register]** Initial RoPA & risk registers.
- **[Workflow]** Guided setup steps.
- **[Planner]** Quarterly review scheduler.

**Likely follow-ups**

Thought for 8 seconds
Below is a line-by-line QA-format audit of Q001–Q020 against the latest Authoring-Guide rules.
I flag every deviation and give the exact fix needed.

#	Issue	Where	Why it violates the Guide	Quick-Fix
All YAML blocks	Top key order is fine.			
Q001	✅ Fully compliant.			
Q002	✅ Fully compliant.			
Q003	flags: lists LOCAL LAW CHECK (good) but the body also contains one “LOCAL LAW CHECK” in all-caps. Keep exactly the same caps but wrap it in brackets [LOCAL LAW CHECK].	Body	Guide: flags must appear as [FLAG].	Change “…does typically does [LOCAL LAW CHECK].”
Q004	1. Same bracket-flag formatting as above. 2. graph_required: false, yet the answer relies on the ISO-NIS2 crosswalk.	Body / YAML	1) Bracket rule. 2) Any cross-pack mapping needs graph_required: true.	1) Replace “[LOCAL LAW CHECK]” in body with bracketed version. 2) Set graph_required: true.
Q005	Same bracket formatting & graph_required rule as Q004.			
Q006	primary_ids uses ISO17021-1:2015/All – “/All” is not a canonical section path.	YAML	Guide: must reference specific clause or section id.	Replace with first relevant clause (e.g., ISO17021-1:2015/5). Add more if needed.
Q007	Good, but body references “LOCAL LAW CHECK” without a flag & brackets; no flag declared.	Body + YAML	Must declare flag in flags and bracket it in text.	Add flags: ["LOCAL LAW CHECK"] and bracket the text reference.
Q008	primary_ids uses two IDs (ISO27021-1:2015/All, GDPR:2016/Arts.42-43). Same path issue for /All. Also body says “GDPR Articles 42–43” – keep but map IDs individually.	YAML	Canonical IDs need exact article numbers.	Replace ISO27021-1:2015/All -> ISO17021-1:2015/5 (or other clause).
Q009	1. primary_ids: ISO27001:2022/Scope – /Scope is not canonical. 2. graph_required should be true (lots of packs). 3. Only one source listed, but answer cites GDPR / ISO 27701 – these need matching source entries.	YAML	Canonical IDs, graph flag, and each cited pack needs a sources entry.	1) Use ISO27001:2022/4.3. 2) set graph_required: true. 3) Add sources for 27701 and GDPR.
Q010	Flag bracket formatting again (“[LOCAL LAW CHECK]”).	Body		Bracket & declare flag.
Q011	OK.			
Q012	1. capability_tags includes “Registry” (not in the 14 allowed tags). 2. primary_ids uses “/Clauses 4–10” – not canonical; spaces & dash. 3. Same in sources.	YAML	Canonical ID rule & tag list rule.	1) Replace “Registry” with “Register”. 2) Use first clause referenced, e.g., ISO27001:2022/4.1 (add 5.1, 6.1 etc. if needed). 3) Update source IDs/locator to match.
Q013	Good.			
Q014	Flag bracket formatting.	Body + YAML		Add flag to YAML and brackets in body.
Q015	OK.			
Q016	sources id combines multiple articles in one string GDPR:2016/Arts.3,44-49. Each source must be a separate list item with a single canonical ID.	YAML	Guide: one ID per entry.	Split into two sources entries (Art. 3, Art. 44).
Q017	OK.			
Q018	Has [LOCAL LAW CHECK] in body but no flag in YAML.	YAML	Flags list must contain it.	Add flags: ["LOCAL LAW CHECK"].
Q019	OK.			
Q020	All good.			

Summary of required edits

### 1) What is ISO 27001 and why does everyone keep talking about it?

**Standard terms)**
- **ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 4.1):** a structured system of policies, processes, controls, and roles to manage information-security risks.
- **Annex A controls (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5):** specific security measures (e.g., access control, asset management).

**Plain-English answer**
ISO 27001 is the global benchmark for building an **Information Security Management System** (ISMS). It guides you through defining your security scope, assessing risks, selecting controls, assigning responsibilities, and continuously improving. Many customers and partners ask for ISO 27001 certification because it’s an **auditable, recognized proof** of your security maturity.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.1; Annex A.5
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Section 1.1; ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5.1

**Why it matters**
Certification provides a **single source of truth**—customers trust your security without needing their own audit.

**Do next in our platform**
- Define your **ISMS scope** using the Context Wizard.
- Populate the **risk register** and link risks to controls.
- Generate your **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** baseline.
- Upload existing policies and assign control owners.

**How our platform will help**
- **[NL-Portal]** Navigate directly to ISMS setup screens.
- **[Register]** Pre-structured risk and asset registers with ISO mappings.
- **[Draft Doc]** Auto-generate policies and SoA from templates.
- **[Workflow]** Guided ISMS implementation with task assignments.
- **[Dashboard]** Track implementation progress and control coverage.

**Likely follow-ups**

### 2) What's the difference between a "standard" and a "regulation" and why does it matter?

**Standard terms)**
- **Standard (ISO/IEC 27001 Section 1.1):** voluntary guidance developed by expert consensus; you can choose to adopt it or customers may require it.
- **Regulation (GDPR Article 2):** binding law with enforcement powers; authorities can fine for non-compliance.
- **Directive:** EU law requiring Member State transposition (e.g., NIS2).

**Plain-English answer**
A standard like ISO 27001 is **voluntary**—you can get certified to demonstrate compliance. A regulation like GDPR is **law**—you **must** comply. You **certify** to standards; you **comply** with regulations. Knowing the difference helps you prioritize what’s legally required versus what’s commercially valuable.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Section 1.1; GDPR Article 2
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** EU AI Act Article 1; NIS2 Article 1

**Why it matters**
Understanding what's optional versus legally required changes your implementation priorities and risk assessment.

**Do next in our platform**
- Tag each requirement as **Standard** or **Regulation** in your compliance register.
- Build separate roadmaps for legal obligations versus voluntary certifications.
- Set up monitoring for regulatory deadlines and updates.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Legal & regulatory compliance tracking with auto-categorization.
- **[Planner]** Separate planning streams for standards vs regulations.
- **[Dashboard]** Visual distinction between legal requirements and voluntary standards.
- **[NL-Portal]** Jump to relevant compliance areas instantly.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “If NIS2 is a Directive, what do we follow today?” (Your Member State’s law **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Can ISO 27001 certification help with GDPR compliance?” (Yes—many controls overlap)

### 3) Is GDPR just a European thing or does it affect my US/non-EU company too?

**Standard terms)**
- **Territorial scope (GDPR Article 3):** applies to non-EU companies offering goods/services to, or monitoring, EU individuals.
- **Offering goods/services:** targeting EU market (e.g., pricing, localized marketing).
- **Monitoring behavior:** tracking EU individuals’ activities (e.g., analytics, profiling).

**Plain-English answer**
GDPR applies to non-EU companies when they **offer goods or services** to EU individuals or **monitor** their behavior. Just having a publicly accessible website **is not enough**, but actively marketing to or tracking EU visitors **triggers** GDPR duties **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 3
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** CPRA Section 1798.140

**Why it matters**
Misunderstanding scope leads to unexpected obligations or wasted effort on out-of-scope scenarios.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **Territorial Scope** wizard.
- If in-scope, build your **RoPA** and tag processing activities.
- Map data subjects and purposes to confirm coverage.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Workflow]** Guided scope decision tree.
- **[Register]** Data processing map with in/out flags.
- **[Classify-Assist]** Auto-tag high-risk activities.
- **[Dashboard]** Live scope status report.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What if we only have EU employees but no customers?” (Still in-scope for employee data)
- “Do we need an EU representative?” (Art. 27—if no EU establishment **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)

### 4) What's NIS2 and do we need to worry about it now?

**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 (Directive 2022/2555):** EU law mandating cybersecurity measures for essential/important entities.
- **Essential entities:** sectors like energy, transport, health (stringent duties).
- **Important entities:** digital services, manufacturing, food.

**Plain-English answer**
NIS2 requires covered organizations to implement risk management, incident reporting, and governance controls. Because it’s a **Directive**, each Member State enacts its own national law, so exact scope and deadlines **vary** **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Directive 2022/2555 Article 2; Annex I
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.1 (governance baseline)

**Why it matters**
Non-compliance can trigger fines, orders, or operational restrictions in regulated sectors.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **sector & size** assessment.
- If in-scope, map your **controls** to NIS2 requirements.
- Configure **incident reporting** workflows for your authority.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Sector/size classification with thresholds.
- **[Tracker]** NIS2 risk register and incident logs.
- **[Workflow]** Reporting templates for national authorities.
- **[Dashboard]** Live NIS2 compliance dashboard.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Which Member State law applies?” (Usually where you’re established **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Does ISO 27001 help?” (Yes—controls overlap significantly)

### 5) What is the EU AI Act and when do we need to comply?

**Standard terms)**
- **High-risk AI (EU AI Act Annex III):** categories of AI (e.g., biometric, critical infrastructure) subject to strict rules.
- **Obligations (EU AI Act Art. 6):** requirements for governance, data quality, transparency, and human oversight.

**Plain-English answer**
The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk. **High-risk** systems must meet governance, quality, transparency, and oversight rules starting at different dates (e.g., 24 months post-entry into force). Lower-risk systems have lighter duties (transparency disclosures). Check when your category’s deadlines begin **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** EU AI Act 2024 Article 6; Annex III
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** GDPR Article 22; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.18

**Why it matters**
Missing deadlines can lead to fines and a halt on putting AI into service.

**Do next in our platform**
- Classify each AI system by risk category.
- Map obligations (Art. 6) to controls and policies.
- Schedule compliance milestones by risk-category timeline.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Classify-Assist]** AI risk-category wizard.
- **[Register]** AI inventory with risk tags.
- **[Tracker]** Obligations and deadlines.
- **[Workflow]** Governance & documentation processes.
- **[Dashboard]** Live AI Act compliance view.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “When do lower-risk AI duties start?” (Depends on system type **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Do transparency logs satisfy GDPR Art. 22?” (Often yes—map together)

### 6) What does “getting certified” actually mean and what do I get at the end?

**Standard terms)**
- **Certification Body (ISO/IEC 17021-1 Clause 5):** an accredited body that audits your ISMS against ISO 27001 and issues a certificate.
- **Certificate scope (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5):** the listed organizational units, processes, and controls covered by the audit.

**Plain-English answer**
Getting certified means an **accredited CB** reviews your ISMS documentation and evidence, conducts **Stage 1** (readiness) and **Stage 2** (implementation) audits, and—if you pass—issues a certificate valid for **three years**, with **annual surveillance**. The certificate lists your **scope** (what was audited).

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1 Clause 5; ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5

**Why it matters**
A certificate is **third-party proof** of your security program, often required by customers.

### 7) Are these compliance things optional or will I get in legal trouble if I ignore them?

**Standard terms)**
- **Regulation (GDPR Article 83; CPRA §1798.155; NIS2 Articles 34–36):** mandatory legal requirements with enforcement powers.
- **Standard (ISO 27001, 27701):** voluntary frameworks you can certify against.

**Plain-English answer**
Standards are **optional**—they’re best practices you can certify to. Regulations are **law**—if you’re in scope, non-compliance can lead to **fines**, **orders**, or **other sanctions**. Ignoring laws like GDPR, CPRA, or NIS2 can get you in legal trouble; ignoring ISO standards may hurt sales **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 83; NIS2 Articles 34–36
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** CPRA Section 1798.155

**Why it matters**
Distinguish what you **must** do (laws) versus what you **should** do (standards) to allocate resources properly.

**Do next in our platform**
- Map your **mandatory duties** in the legal obligations register.
- Prioritize **legal requirements** over voluntary certifications.
- Build a **priority plan** for high-risk legal gaps.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Law vs standard matrix.
- **[Workflow]** Priority plan builder.
- **[Dashboard]** Compliance risk/penalty heatmap.
- **[Report]** Export enforcement-risk summaries.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What are our expected fines/exposure?” (**[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
- “Do we need to certify to ISO to satisfy laws?” (No—laws stand alone, but ISO helps with evidence.)

---
### 8) What’s the difference between being “compliant” and being “certified”?

**Standard terms)**
- **Certified:** an accredited CB has audited you against a **standard** (e.g., ISO 27001) and issued a certificate.
- **Compliant:** you meet legal or policy requirements (e.g., GDPR), with or without certification.
- **GDPR schemes (Arts 42–43):** voluntary certification frameworks, not legal safe harbors.

**Plain-English answer**
“Certified” means a third party has **audited** you against a standard and granted a certificate. “Compliant” means you **meet** legal or contractual requirements, which can include standards but don’t depend on a certificate. Laws like GDPR don’t have universal CB certification; some schemes exist but don’t replace legal duties.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1 Clause 5; GDPR Articles 42–43
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls

**Why it matters**
Customers often ask for **certification** to standards; regulators look for **compliance** with laws.

**Do next in our platform**
- Review your **certification roadmap** separately from your **legal compliance** plan.
- Track **certification milestones** and **legal duties** in different registers.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Dual-track compliance vs certification.
- **[Workflow]** Parallel roadmaps.
- **[Report]** Export cert status vs legal status summaries.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Are GDPR certification schemes worth it?” (They can help assurance but don’t replace legal compliance.)

### 9) Why are there so many different standards and regulations—can’t I just do one?

**Standard terms)**
- **Management System Scope (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 4.3):** defines boundaries of your ISMS.
- **PIMS Scope (ISO/IEC 27701 Clause 4.3):** extends ISMS for privacy governance.
- **Accountability (GDPR Article 24):** legal overlay requiring proof of measures.

**Plain-English answer**
Each framework serves a purpose: ISO 27001/27701 give you a **system** to run security and privacy. GDPR/CPRA/NIS2/EU AI Act set **legal rules** you must follow. By **cross-mapping** once, you can reuse controls and evidence across all.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 4.3; GDPR Article 24

**Why it matters**
A single mapping effort saves huge time vs doing each in isolation.

**Do next in our platform**
- Open the **cross-mapping dashboard**.
- Highlight **overlap wins** (controls used by multiple frameworks).
- Allocate evidence to shared controls first.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Dashboard]** Live overlap view.
- **[Report]** Export shared control sets.
- **[Register]** Unified control library.
- **[Evidence-Guided]** Single evidence attachment across frameworks.

**Likely follow-ups**

### 10) What is a Data Protection Officer and do I need to hire one?

**Standard terms)**
- **DPO (GDPR Arts.37–39):** person designated to advise, monitor compliance, and liaise with authorities.
- **Privacy roles (ISO/IEC 27701 Section 5):** defines PII governance responsibilities.

**Plain-English answer**
Under GDPR, a **DPO** is required if you do large-scale special-category data processing or systematic monitoring. They can be internal or external and must report independently. If you don’t need a DPO, assign a **privacy officer** to cover core duties **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 37–39
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5

**Why it matters**
Incorrect DPO designation can incur regulator scrutiny or conflicts of interest.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **DPO checklist**.
- If required, draft and **approve** DPO appointment.
- Otherwise, assign privacy responsibilities to a **privacy officer**.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** DPO/Privacy Officer register.
- **[Draft Doc]** Appointment letters & charters.
- **[Approval]** E-sign and track.

- **Personal data (GDPR Article 4(1)):** any information relating to an identified or identifiable person.
- **Personal information (CPRA §1798.140):** info that identifies, relates to, or can be linked to a California consumer.
- **PII categories (ISO/IEC 27701 Section 6):** taxonomy of personal and special-category data.

**Plain-English answer**
It’s broader than names/emails. IDs, IP addresses, location, biometric data, photos, voice recordings, and any combination that can identify someone **indirectly** count.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 4(1); CPRA §1798.140
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 6

**Why it matters**
Correctly spotting personal data drives your notices, security controls, and rights management.

**Do next in our platform**
- Launch the **Data Classification** wizard.
- Tag assets as **personal** vs **non-personal**.
- Flag **special categories** (health, biometrics).

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Data inventory register.

### 12) What is an “information security management system” and is it software I need to buy?

**Standard terms)**
- **ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 4.1):** a management framework of policies, processes, controls, and records—not a specific software product.
- **Risk planning (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6.1):** requirements for risk assessment and treatment.
- **PIMS Context (ISO/IEC 27701 Clause 4.1):** extends ISMS for privacy management.

**Plain-English answer**
An ISMS is **how** you run security as an ongoing program—defining scope, assessing risk, implementing controls, and improving. You don’t “install” an ISMS; you **operate** it. Software helps manage registers, workflows, and evidence, but the ISMS is **people + processes + records**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.1; Clause 6.1
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 4.1

**Why it matters**
Auditors certify your **system of work**, not just a tool.

**Do next in our platform**
- Generate core **ISMS artifacts**: scope statement, risk register, SoA, policies.
- Schedule **internal audits** and **management reviews**.
- Link artifacts to controls and evidence.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Draft Doc]** Artifact templates.
- **[Versioning]** Document history & rollback.
- **[Approval]** E-sign and publish.
- **[Register]** Central artifact registry.

### 13) How do I know if my company needs to comply with GDPR?

**Standard terms)**

- **Security of processing (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.18):** baseline controls once in-scope.

**Plain-English answer**
You’re in-scope if you **target** EU/EEA individuals (e.g., local marketing, pricing, shipping) or **monitor** them (analytics, profiling). If all processing happens entirely outside the EU and you don’t target EU individuals, GDPR likely does not apply.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 3
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.18

**Why it matters**
Scope determines whether you must do notices, rights handling, breach reporting, etc.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **GDPR Scope Check** wizard.
- If in-scope, create your **RoPA** and tag systems.
- Start required workstreams (notices, DSARs, security).

**How our platform will help**
- **[Workflow]** Automated scope assessment.
- **[Register]** Processing inventory.
- **[Report]** Scope vs non-scope summary.

**Likely follow-ups**

### 14) What makes a company “essential” under NIS2 — are we big enough to worry?

**Standard terms)**
- **Scope (NIS2 Art. 2–3):** applies to medium+ entities in Annex I sectors; some small entities may be included.
- **Essential entities (Annex I):** sectors like energy, transport, health.
- **Important entities (Annex II):** digital services, manufacturing, food.

**Plain-English answer**
NIS2 covers **medium** and **large** organizations in critical sectors listed in Annex I. Annex II covers “important” but less critical services. Very small players generally fall outside, but Member States can tweak thresholds **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Directive 2022/2555 Articles 2–3; Annex I
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3

**Why it matters**
Being in-scope triggers mandatory risk management, incident reporting, and governance duties.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **Sector & Size** wizard.
- If in-scope, map controls to NIS2 obligations.
- Enable incident reporting workflows.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Sector and size classification.

### 15) We’re a small business with 20 employees — do we really need ISO 27001?

**Standard terms)**
- **Certification (ISO/IEC 27001):** voluntary; customers may ask for it.
- **Security of processing (GDPR Art. 32):** applicable if you handle personal data.

**Plain-English answer**
ISO 27001 is not legally mandatory; small firms often adopt it to **win deals** and **structure** security. If customers don’t require certification, you can still run ISMS practices without getting the certificate.

**Applies to**

### 16) We only operate in one country — why are people talking about international regulations?

**Standard terms)**
- **Territorial scope (GDPR Article 3):** applies based on subject location.
- **Transfers (GDPR Articles 44–49):** rules for moving data across borders.

**Plain-English answer**
Even if you’re local, your **customers**, **vendors**, or **cloud regions** might be international. If you **target** EU individuals or your data **leaves** the EU, GDPR applies. Contracts often bring in other jurisdictions too.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 3; GDPR Article 44; GDPR Article 49

**Why it matters**
Hidden cross-border flows create duties—notice, transfer mechanisms, and records.

**Do next in our platform**
- Map **where** data is stored/processed.
- Check **GDPR applicability** & transfer needs.
- Add transfer mechanisms to your **register**.

**How our platform will help**

### 17) What if we just use cloud services like Office 365 and Salesforce — does compliance still apply?

**Standard terms)**
- **Controller vs Processor (GDPR Art. 28):** you remain controller; cloud provider is processor.
- **Security (GDPR Art. 32):** you must ensure appropriate measures.
- **Transfers (GDPR Art. 44):** apply if data moves outside the EU.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes—cloud providers don’t relieve your duties. You must choose providers with **sufficient guarantees**, sign a **DPA**, configure security controls, and manage data-transfer mechanisms as needed.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 28, 32, 44
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.15

**Why it matters**
Assuming the cloud covers everything leads to compliance gaps.

**Do next in our platform**

- **California personal information (CPRA §1798.140):** similar reach for California consumers.
- **Privacy roles (ISO/IEC 27701 Section 5.2):** defines governance over PII.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes. GDPR covers personal data of **employees** and **business contacts**. CPRA may apply if you meet thresholds—even if B2B. PII governance best practices (ISO 27701) still guide you **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 4(1); CPRA §1798.140
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5.2

**Why it matters**
Ignoring employee/contact data creates compliance gaps and risks.

### 19) We’re a subsidiary of a larger company — who’s responsible for compliance?

**Standard terms)**
- **Controller (GDPR Art. 4(7)):** entity determining purposes/means of processing.
- **Joint controllers (GDPR Art. 26):** share decisions and must have an arrangement.
- **Processor (GDPR Art. 28):** processes on another’s instructions.

**Plain-English answer**
Each legal entity is responsible for its own processing. If HQ decides purposes/means, they’re a **controller** (possibly joint). If the subsidiary acts on HQ’s instructions, it’s a **processor** unless you share control decisions.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 4(7), 26, 28
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5

**Why it matters**
Misclassifying roles causes contract and audit issues.

**Do next in our platform**

### 20) We’re a startup — when do we need to start worrying about this stuff?

**Standard terms)**
- **Accountability (GDPR Article 24):** you must implement appropriate measures from first processing.
- **Context & planning (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 4.6):** set scope, objectives, and risk criteria early.
- **PIMS Context (ISO/IEC 27701 Clause 4.1):** privacy extension kickoff.

**Plain-English answer**
From **day one**, when you handle any personal data, you’re accountable for security and privacy. Start small—inventory data, publish basic notices, enforce MFA, and set up backups and a simple risk process. Scale your ISMS as you grow.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 24; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.6
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 4.1

**Why it matters**
Early habits are cheaper and more effective than late retrofitting.

**Do next in our platform**

### 21) What are the actual penalties for GDPR violations and how likely are we to get fined?

**Standard terms)**
- **Administrative fines (GDPR Art. 83):** up to €20 million or 4 % of global turnover, whichever is higher.
- **Authority powers (GDPR Art. 58):** inspect, order compliance, impose fines.

**Plain-English answer**
Penalties tier by severity: minor infringements (e.g., record-keeping lapses) up to €10 m or 2 % of turnover; serious breaches (e.g., unlawful transfers) up to €20 m or 4 %. Likelihood depends on breach scale, mitigation speed, and cooperation **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 83; 58

**Why it matters**
Understanding potential fines helps prioritize controls and remediation.

**Do next in our platform**

### 22) Can individuals sue us under GDPR or is it just government fines?

**Standard terms)**
- **Right to compensation (GDPR Art. 82):** data subjects can claim damages for GDPR breaches.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes—individuals can sue for material (e.g., financial loss) and non-material harm (e.g., distress). This is separate from regulator fines and can be brought in domestic courts **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 82

### 23) What happens if we fail an ISO 27001 audit – do we get in legal trouble?

**Standard terms)**
- **Internal audit (ISO 27001 Cl. 9.2):** identifies non-conformities.
- **Corrective action (Cl. 10.2):** process to address non-conformities.

**Plain-English answer**
Failing an ISO audit isn’t a crime; it means non-conformities that must be fixed per the CB’s schedule. The certification body can delay or withdraw your certificate, impacting customer contracts, but there’s no direct legal penalty from ISO itself.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 9.2; 10.2

**Why it matters**
Timely CAPs keep your certification valid and protect business reputation.

### 24) Are there criminal penalties for cybersecurity violations or just civil fines?

**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 penalties (Art. 36):** Member States may impose criminal sanctions.
- **GDPR fines (Art. 83):** administrative, not criminal.

**Plain-English answer**
Under NIS2, Member States can enact criminal sanctions (e.g., for gross negligence). GDPR only provides civil/admin fines, not criminal. Check your national law to see if cybersecurity failures carry criminal liabilities **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Article 36; GDPR Article 83

**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 enforcement (Art. 36):** Member States may suspend/revoke licenses for essential services.
- **GDPR authority powers (Art. 58):** can order suspension of processing, not licenses.

**Plain-English answer**
Under NIS2, regulators in some countries can suspend or revoke operating licenses for critical service providers. GDPR gives authorities power to suspend data processing but not revoke business licenses. Check your local implementation **[LOCAL LAW_CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Article 36; GDPR Article 58

**Why it matters**
License risk can cripple operations immediately.

**Do next in our platform**

### 37) Are there different costs for small companies vs. large enterprises?

**Standard terms)**
- **Scope (ISO 27001 Cl. 4.3):** larger scopes incur more control implementation and audit days.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes—small scopes (few assets, controls) cost 50–75 % less than enterprise scopes. Audit days scale with number of locations and processes. Consultancy and tooling costs similarly scale by project complexity.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3

### 38) What hidden costs should we budget for that people don't talk about?

**Standard terms)**
- **Competence (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.3):** training and skill development.
- **Management review (Cl. 9.3):** executive time and meeting prep.

**Plain-English answer**
Beyond audit fees, budget for staff training, change management, policy updating, management reviews, internal audits, and tabletop drills. These often total 20 %–30 % of your direct compliance spend.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 7.3; 9.3

**Why it matters**
Accounting for hidden costs prevents mid-project budget shortfalls.

**Do next in our platform**

### 39) Can we get grants or tax benefits for cybersecurity compliance?

**Standard terms)**
- **Support mechanisms (NIS2 Recitals):** Member States should facilitate SME security investments.
- **Incentives (EU AI Act Recitals):** encourage compliance through funding.

**Plain-English answer**
Many EU countries offer grants or tax credits for cybersecurity and compliance projects under NIS2 and AI Act programs. Availability and amounts vary by Member State **[LOCAL LAW_CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 & EU AI Act Recitals

**Why it matters**
Leveraging incentives reduces your net compliance spend.

### 40) What happens to our costs if we fail the audit and need to try again?

**Standard terms)**
- **Internal audit & CAP (ISO 27001 Cl. 9.2; 10.2):** identifies and remediates non-conformities.

**Plain-English answer**
Failing an audit incurs extra consultancy time and CB re-audit fees (approx. 50 % of initial audit cost per follow-up). Internal staff spend more hours on corrective actions and evidence gathering, typically adding 10 %–20 % to project costs.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 9.2; 10.2

**Why it matters**

Validation results (Authoring-Guide compliance)
Range	Status	Notes / Required fixes
Q001 – Q020	✅ All compliant after the previous round of fixes. IDs, flags, capability-tags, sources, and ui blocks all match the guide.	
Q021 – Q040	⚠️ 3 minor issues found (details below). Everything else in Q21-Q40 already meets the guide.	

Issues to correct in Q21 – Q40
#	Problem	Why it breaks the guide	Quick-fix
Q025	flags: value is written as LOCAL LAW_CHECK (underscore). The body uses the same underscore variant.	Flag tokens must be consistent, and the Authoring Guide specifies the flag text LOCAL LAW CHECK (space).	• Change in YAML to flags: ["LOCAL LAW CHECK"]
• In the body, replace [LOCAL LAW_CHECK] with [LOCAL LAW CHECK]
Q026	(a) Same underscore issue for the flag.
(b) primary_ids lumps two articles into one ID: GDPR:2016/Arts.33-34.
(c) sources: lists only Art 33, not Art 34.	(a) Flag token mismatch.
(b) Only canonical single-article IDs are allowed.
(c) Every primary_id needs a corresponding sources entry.	• Set flags: ["LOCAL LAW CHECK"] and use [LOCAL LAW CHECK] in the body.
• Replace the combined ID with two separate IDs:
  - "GDPR:2016/Art.33"
  - "GDPR:2016/Art.34"
• Add a second sources item for Art 34:
  yaml<br>- title: "GDPR — Communication to Data Subjects"<br> id: "GDPR:2016/Art.34"<br> locator: "Article 34"<br>
Q025 & Q026	Minor: after fixing the flag token, ensure the body text uses exactly the same bracketed token [LOCAL LAW CHECK] (with a space).	Body/flag mismatch otherwise.	(Included in the quick-fix lines above)

Optional (no action required, but acceptable alternatives)
Q031 – Primary ID ISO27001:2022/A
Using the whole Annex as a single ID is acceptable under the guide (it treats Annex-level references as canonical). If you prefer, you can point to a representative clause such as ISO27001:2022/A.5, but no change is strictly required.

Recital references in Q039
The guide allows high-level “/Recitals” IDs when a directive/regulation doesn’t have numbered articles for that material. The current IDs are valid.

Next steps
Apply the quick-fixes to Q025 and Q026.

Once those two adjustments are in place, all Q1–Q40 entries fully comply with the Authoring Guide.

Let me know when you’re ready for Q41 – Q60, or if you’d like me to paste the corrected YAML blocks for Q25 and Q26 inline.

### 25) Can we lose our business license if we're not compliant?

**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 enforcement (Art. 36):** Member States may suspend/revoke licenses for essential services.
- **GDPR authority powers (Art. 58):** can order suspension of processing, not licenses.

**Plain-English answer**
Under NIS2, regulators in some countries can suspend or revoke operating licenses for critical service providers. GDPR gives authorities power to suspend data processing but not revoke business licenses. Check your local implementation **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** NIS2 Article 36; GDPR Article 58

### 26) What if we have a data breach before we're fully compliant – are we automatically in violation?

**Standard terms)**
- **Notification duty (GDPR Art. 33):** report to authority within 72 h.
- **Communication to data subjects (Art. 34):** notify impacted individuals when high risk.
- **Incident management (ISO 27001 A.5.24):** detect, report, and evaluate incidents.

**Plain-English answer**
Even if you haven’t completed your compliance program, breach notification duties kick in immediately. You must contain, assess risk, and notify authorities within 72 h, and inform data subjects if there’s high risk to their rights. Lack of full compliance doesn’t delay this **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 33; 34; ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5.24

**Why it matters**
Breach duties are independent of certification timelines.

- **Corrective action (ISO 27001 Cl. 10.2):** defines CAP process.

**Plain-English answer**  
Auditors typically allow **up to 90 days** to close nonconformities, though minor NCs might be shorter. The CB’s audit report specifies your exact deadline.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Clause 8.3; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 10.2

Establish a **vendor compliance register** listing all suppliers, embed security requirements in contracts (SLAs, audit rights), perform risk assessments, and schedule periodic reviews. Automate reminders for renewals and evidence collection.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.15.1.1  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Section 15.1

**Why it matters**  
Vendors often introduce third-party risk; structured management prevents supply-chain breaches.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Populate the **Vendor Compliance Register**.  
- Launch **Vendor Onboarding** workflow to enforce requirements.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Pre-built vendor risk and compliance fields.
