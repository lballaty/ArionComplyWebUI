### 31) What does it actually cost to get ISO 27001 certified from start to finish?

**Standard terms)**
- **Annex A controls:** number and complexity affect audit time and fees.

**Plain-English answer**
Total costs include consultant fees, internal labor, and certification body charges. For a mid-sized scope, expect €15 k–€50 k consultancy + €5 k–€15 k CB fees. Internal effort (project mgmt, documentation) adds equivalent to ~€20 k–€40 k. Your mileage will vary by scope and geography.
