### 188) Do we need different compliance approaches for public vs. private cloud?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Teleworking & mobile (A.6.2.1):** ensures secure remote/cloud access.

**Plain-English answer**  
**Private cloud** often mimics on-prem controls (firewalls, VLANs). **Public cloud** relies on IAM, API logging, and provider-native security services. Map your ISMS controls to each environment accordingly.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.6.2.1

**Why it matters**  
Ensures consistent security posture across diverse platforms.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Run **Cloud Deployment Assessment** workflow.  
- Tag each workload as public or private in the **Cloud Register**.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Environment-specific control templates.  
- **[Dashboard]** Compliance score by deployment type.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- How to manage hybrid-cloud control inheritance?  
- What network controls apply to public cloud?
