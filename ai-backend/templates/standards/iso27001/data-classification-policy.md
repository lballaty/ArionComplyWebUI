## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of data classification like organizing a vast library system.** Just as libraries use sophisticated cataloging systems (fiction, non-fiction, reference, rare books) with different access levels and storage requirements, organizations must systematically categorize their information assets based on value, sensitivity, and risk. A rare manuscript requires climate-controlled storage and restricted access, while general circulation books can be freely browsed - similarly, your customer database needs maximum protection while your marketing brochures can be publicly shared.

Data classification provides the **foundational framework** for all other security controls - it's impossible to properly protect what you cannot properly categorize and understand.

[Organization Name] is committed to implementing a comprehensive data classification framework that ensures appropriate protection of information assets based on their value, sensitivity, and criticality to business operations. This policy establishes systematic procedures for identifying, classifying, labeling, and handling information throughout its lifecycle to support regulatory compliance and risk management objectives.
