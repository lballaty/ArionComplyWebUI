### 87) How do we handle compliance across multiple locations or remote work?

**Standard terms**  
- **Scope (Cl. 4.3):** define ISMS boundaries including locations.  
- **Organizational roles (Cl. 5.3):** clarify responsibilities per site.  
- **PIMS context (ISO 27701 Cl. 4.3):** extends scope to privacy.

**Plain-English answer**  
Define a **central ISMS policy** and tailor site-specific registers. Use a **site matrix** to track local risks, controls, and contacts. Remote workers follow the same controls via virtual checklists and approvals.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 4.3; 5.3  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 4.3

**Why it matters**  
Consistent yet flexible approach ensures coverage without duplication.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Run **Multi-Location Setup** workflow.  
- Populate **Site Matrix** with key details.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Site configuration wizard.  
- **[Register]** Centralized site & risk matrix.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “How to audit remote employees?” (Use virtual evidence collection)
