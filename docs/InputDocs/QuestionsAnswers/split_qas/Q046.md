### 46) How often do we need to do internal audits and how long do they take?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Internal audit (Cl. 9.2):** required at planned intervals, no less than annually.

**Plain-English answer**  
ISO 27001 mandates at least one full internal audit per year. Duration varies: 1–2 days for small scopes, up to 5 days for complex, multi-site ISMS.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 9.2

**Why it matters**  
Proper scheduling avoids audit cram and fatigue.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Generate **audit calendar**.  
- Allocate **auditor** and **teams**.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Planner]** Internal audit scheduler.  
- **[Dashboard]** Audit progress tracker.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “Can we combine internal and surveillance audits?” (Yes—coordinate schedules)
