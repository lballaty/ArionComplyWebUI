## Screens: `planningHub.html` with various integrated views

### Overview
The Integrated Planning and Task Management system provides a unified approach to managing activities, tasks, deadlines, and resources across the organization. Rather than treating calendar, scheduling, tasks, Kanban, and timeline views as separate modules, this system consolidates them into a cohesive planning hub with multiple visualization options for the same underlying data. This integration allows users to seamlessly transition between different views based on their current planning needs while maintaining data consistency.

The system emphasizes contextual awareness, allowing tasks to be associated with relevant records (risks, assets, etc.) and compliance requirements, creating a traceable link between planning activities and compliance objectives. All views update in real-time when changes occur, ensuring all team members have the most current information regardless of which visualization they prefer.

### Integration Architecture
