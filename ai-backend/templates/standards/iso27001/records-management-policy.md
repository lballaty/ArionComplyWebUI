## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of records management like operating the National Archives - a sophisticated system for preserving, organizing, and providing access to valuable historical documents.** Just as the Archives maintains detailed catalogs, implements strict preservation standards, controls access based on sensitivity levels, and follows precise retention schedules for different document types, organizations must systematically manage their business records throughout their entire lifecycle. A presidential document requires different handling than a routine administrative memo, yet both must be properly cataloged, preserved, and eventually disposed of according to established schedules.

Records management provides the **systematic foundation** for information governance, ensuring that valuable business information is preserved, accessible when needed, and securely disposed of when its retention period expires.
