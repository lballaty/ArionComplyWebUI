### 60) Can we start implementing before we fully understand all the requirements?

**Standard terms**  
- **Risk treatment planning (ISO 27001 Cl. 6.1):** plan iterative control deployment.  
- **Accountability (GDPR Art. 24):** implement appropriate measures from the outset.

**Plain-English answer**  
Yes—use a **phased approach**: implement **MVP controls** (scope, MFA, incident plan) first, then refine as you map detailed requirements. This delivers immediate protection while you flesh out the rest.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 6.1; GDPR Article 24

**Why it matters**  
Early action reduces risk and supports incremental learning.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch **Phased Implementation** workflow.  
- Define Phase 1 deliverables.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Phase-by-phase task manager.  
- **[Report]** Phase completion tracker.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “How do we scope Phase 2?” (Based on risk and overlap analysis)
