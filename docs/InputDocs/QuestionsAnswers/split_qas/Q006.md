### 6) What does “getting certified” actually mean and what do I get at the end?

**Standard terms)**
- **Certification Body (ISO/IEC 17021-1 Clause 5):** an accredited body that audits your ISMS against ISO 27001 and issues a certificate.
- **Certificate scope (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5):** the listed organizational units, processes, and controls covered by the audit.

**Plain-English answer**
Getting certified means an **accredited CB** reviews your ISMS documentation and evidence, conducts **Stage 1** (readiness) and **Stage 2** (implementation) audits, and—if you pass—issues a certificate valid for **three years**, with **annual surveillance**. The certificate lists your **scope** (what was audited).

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1 Clause 5; ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5

**Why it matters**
A certificate is **third-party proof** of your security program, often required by customers.

**Do next in our platform**
- Plan your **audit readiness**: schedule internal audits and reviews.
- Build an **evidence pack** mapped to clauses/controls.
- Book your CB and align on scope.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Planner]** Audit calendar and reminders.
- **[Reminder]** SLA timers for evidence collection.
- **[Workflow]** Audit pack builder.
- **[Report]** Exportable audit evidence.
- **[Evidence-Guided]** Guided prompts for exactly what proof is needed.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “How long and how much?” (See Q031–Q040 & Q051–Q060)
- “Can we do Stage 1 remotely?” (Depends on CB—**[CB POLICY VARIES]**)
