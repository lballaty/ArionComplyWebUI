### 241) How do we get back to good standing after compliance violations?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Improvement (ISO 27001 Cl.10.1):** corrective actions and continual improvement.  
- **Supervisory measures (GDPR Art.58):** possible orders and sanctions.  
- **NIS2 corrective measures (Art.24):** national authority steps.

**Plain-English answer**  
1. **Contain** the breach or non-conformity.  
2. **Assess** root causes and document them.  
3. **Implement** a remediation plan with prioritized corrective actions.  
4. **Engage** regulators early—submitting progress reports can demonstrate good faith.  
5. **Validate** fixes via internal audit before requesting closure from authorities.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 10.1  
- **Also relevant:** GDPR Article 58; NIS2 Article 24

**Why it matters**  
Swift, transparent remediation limits fines, restores customer confidence, and resets your compliance program.

**Do next in our platform**  
1. Launch the **Remediation Plan** workflow.  
2. Populate the **Non-Compliance Log** with details and status.  
3. Schedule follow-up reviews until all actions are verified.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Templates for corrective actions and evidence collection.  
- **[Tracker]** Progress dashboard with deadlines and completion flags.  
- **[Report]** Automated letters to regulators outlining your remediation steps.
