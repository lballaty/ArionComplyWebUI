### 120) What if we want to stop being certified—can we just let it expire?

**Standard terms**  
- **Suspension & withdrawal (ISO 17021-1 Cl. 8.4):** auditor’s actions for non‐renewal.

**Plain-English answer**  
If you miss surveillance or formally notify your CB, certification will be **withdrawn**. You won’t face fines, but customers lose trust. Keep evidence archived if you later reapply.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Clause 8.4

**Why it matters**  
Helps you understand exit consequences and plan knowledge retention.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch **Certification Exit** workflow.  
- Archive all ISMS evidence in the platform.

**How our platform will help**

- **[Reminder]** Final evidence backup alerts.

**Likely follow-ups**
