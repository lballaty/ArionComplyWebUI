- **Resource Optimization**: Focus limited resources where they'll do the most good
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Required by ISO 27001 and many other standards
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Demonstrate professional approach to risk management
- **Incident Prevention**: Address vulnerabilities before they're exploited

**RISK ASSESSMENT COMPONENTS:**

**Assets**: What you're protecting
- Information assets (databases, documents, intellectual property)
- System assets (servers, networks, applications)
- Physical assets (facilities, equipment, media)
- People assets (employees, contractors, their knowledge)

**Threats**: What could cause harm
- Cyber threats (hackers, malware, denial of service)
- Human threats (malicious insiders, human error, social engineering)

**WHAT RISK TREATMENT MEANS:**
Risk treatment is like choosing how to handle health risks after a medical exam. For each identified risk, you must decide whether to treat it, accept it, avoid it, or transfer it to someone else (like insurance).

**FOUR RISK TREATMENT OPTIONS:**

**Risk Modification (Most Common):**
- Implement security controls to reduce likelihood or impact
- Examples: Install firewalls, implement access controls, provide training
- Goal: Reduce risk to acceptable levels

**Risk Acceptance:**
- Consciously decide to accept the risk without further treatment
- Requires formal approval from appropriate management level
- Must be within organization's risk appetite

**Risk Avoidance:**
- Eliminate the risk by not engaging in the activity
- Examples: Don't store sensitive data, don't use risky technologies
- Most extreme option, may impact business operations

**Risk Sharing/Transfer:**
- Transfer risk to third parties through contracts or insurance
- Examples: Cyber insurance, cloud service agreements, outsourcing
- Risk isn't eliminated, but consequences are shared
