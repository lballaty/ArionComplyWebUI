### 40) What happens to our costs if we fail the audit and need to try again?

**Standard terms)**
- **Internal audit & CAP (ISO 27001 Cl. 9.2; 10.2):** identifies and remediates non-conformities.

**Plain-English answer**
Failing an audit incurs extra consultancy time and CB re-audit fees (approx. 50 % of initial audit cost per follow-up). Internal staff spend more hours on corrective actions and evidence gathering, typically adding 10 %–20 % to project costs.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 9.2; 10.2

**Why it matters**
Anticipating re-audit costs avoids surprises and accelerates closure.

**Do next in our platform**
- Estimate **re-audit fees** in your cost model.
- Track **CAP hours** and adjust budget.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Planner]** Re-audit cost estimator.
- **[Report]** CAP effort dashboard.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Can we negotiate reduced re-audit fees?” (Ask CB for bundle discounts)
