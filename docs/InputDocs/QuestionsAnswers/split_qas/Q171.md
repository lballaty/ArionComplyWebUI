### 171) Does using AI in our products or services trigger additional compliance requirements?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **High-risk AI (EU AI Act Art. 5):** categories of AI use subject to strict obligations, such as in critical infrastructure, law enforcement, or employment decisions.  
- **Automated decision-making (GDPR Art. 22):** rules for decisions producing legal or significant effects on individuals without human involvement.

**Plain-English answer**  
Yes — under the **EU AI Act**, certain AI applications are classified as high-risk and require risk management, documentation, transparency, and human oversight. Under **GDPR**, if your AI makes automated decisions about individuals with significant effects, you must provide safeguards, such as human review and clear explanations. Even non-high-risk AI may require transparency, ethical review, and impact assessments, depending on the context.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** EU AI Act Article 5; GDPR Article 22

**Why it matters**  
Early classification of AI systems helps avoid compliance failures and costly retrofits.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Review the **AI Compliance Register** to list all AI-enabled products and services.  
- Launch **AI Risk Classification** workflow to determine if they are high-risk or trigger GDPR safeguards.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Maintain a central record of AI systems, risk categories, and compliance status.  
- **[Workflow]** Guide through AI risk classification and required controls.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “Do we need to conduct an AI impact assessment?” (Yes, for high-risk AI or when GDPR requires it) [LOCAL LAW CHECK]
