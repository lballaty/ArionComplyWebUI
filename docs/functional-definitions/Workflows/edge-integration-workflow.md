# Edge Integration and Offline Mode Workflow

## Overview

The ArionComply platform uses an edge-first architecture that optimizes data flow between client devices, edge functions, database services, and LLM processing. This architecture carefully balances performance, data security, and offline capabilities while minimizing device storage requirements. All communication between components flows through edge functions, creating a streamlined and secure communication channel while supporting limited offline functionality.

## Architectural Components

### 1. Client-Side Application
- **Web/Mobile Interface**: React-based frontend with responsive design
- **Local Storage**: Minimal cached data for essential offline functions
- **Service Worker**: Manages offline capabilities and synchronization
- **Lightweight LLM**: Optional device-local small model for basic offline assistance

### 2. Edge Functions Layer
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client-server communication
- **Request Router**: Directs requests to appropriate handlers
- **Authentication Handler**: Manages user authentication and session tokens
- **Data Validation**: Validates requests before processing
- **Caching Layer**: Intelligent caching of frequently accessed data
- **Synchronization Manager**: Handles offline data synchronization

### 3. Database Services
- **Supabase Backend**: Primary data storage for all platform data
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Managed through edge for efficiency
- **Data Access Controls**: Enforced at database and edge layers
- **Change Tracking**: Versioning system for conflict resolution

### 4. LLM Processing
- **AI Service Integration**: Connection to cloud-based LLM services
- **Context Management**: Efficient packaging of context for LLM requests
- **Response Processing**: Parsing and formatting LLM responses
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when LLM unavailable

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Online Standard Operation
```
Client → Edge Functions → Database/LLM → Edge Functions → Client
```
- All requests pass through edge functions
- Edge functions handle authentication, validation, and routing
- Edge maintains efficient connections to database and LLM services
- Responses flow back through edge with appropriate formatting

### 2. Offline Operation
```
Client → Local Cache → Service Worker → Client
```
- Limited functionality based on cached data
- Essential operations continue with local data
- Changes queued for later synchronization
- UI clearly indicates offline status and limitations

### 3. Reconnection Synchronization
```
Client → Service Worker → Edge Sync Function → Database → Edge → Client
```
- Queued changes sent to edge synchronization endpoint
- Edge handles conflict resolution and batch processing
- Database updated with reconciled changes
- Client receives confirmation and refreshed data

## User Workflows in Relation to Edge Architecture

### User-Triggered Actions

#### 1. Authentication Flow

- **Action**: User login
  - **Online Path**:
    - Credentials sent to edge authentication function
    - Edge validates with database and generates session token
    - Minimal user context cached locally
    - Full session established
  - **Offline Path**:
    - Cached credentials validated against stored session data
    - Limited session established with clear offline indicators
    - Full authentication occurs on reconnection

- **Action**: Session maintenance
  - **Online Path**:
    - Periodic token refresh through edge function
    - Seamless session continuation
  - **Offline Path**:
    - Extended use of existing token
    - Grace period for offline operation
    - Session refreshed on reconnection

#### 2. Data Access and Modification

- **Action**: View content (list, dashboard, detail screens)
  - **Online Path**:
    - Request sent to edge data function
    - Edge retrieves data from database with permission filtering
    - Complete, fresh data returned to client
  - **Offline Path**:
    - Service worker provides cached data for critical screens
    - UI indicates data may not be current
    - Limited to previously viewed/cached content

- **Action**: Create/update content
  - **Online Path**:
    - Changes sent to edge data function
    - Edge validates and writes to database
    - Confirmation returned to client
    - Real-time updates triggered for other users
  - **Offline Path**:
    - Changes stored in change queue
    - UI updated with pending changes
    - Synchronization attempted when connection restored

#### 3. AI Assistant Interaction

- **Action**: Chat with AI assistant
  - **Online Path**:
    - Query sent to edge AI function
    - Edge enriches context and forwards to LLM
    - Response processed and returned to client
    - Interaction history stored in database
  - **Offline Path**:
    - If device has lightweight LLM: Basic responses generated locally
    - If no local LLM: Clear indication of unavailability
    - Limited to pre-cached help content
    - Queries queued for processing on reconnection

- **Action**: AI-powered content generation
  - **Online Path**:
    - Request sent to edge AI function with context
    - Edge forwards to appropriate LLM with optimized context
    - Generated content returned and applied
  - **Offline Path**:
    - Feature unavailable in offline mode
    - Request queued if initiated while offline
    - Clear UI indication of limitation

#### 4. Search Functionality

- **Action**: Search across content
  - **Online Path**:
    - Query sent to edge search function
    - Edge executes optimized search against database/search service
    - Complete results returned with permissions applied
  - **Offline Path**:
    - Limited search across cached content only
    - Clear indication of limited search scope
    - Full search executed on reconnection if requested

#### 5. Synchronization Actions

- **Action**: Manual sync request
  - **Trigger**: User clicks sync button when connection restored
  - **Process**:
    - Client sends all queued changes to edge sync function
    - Edge processes changes in appropriate order
    - Conflicts identified and resolved (automated or with user input)
    - Client state updated with current server state
  - **State Changes**:
    - Queued changes committed or rejected
    - Local cache refreshed with server data
    - Sync status updated

- **Action**: Background sync
  - **Trigger**: Connection restored (detected by service worker)
  - **Process**:
    - Similar to manual sync but initiated automatically
    - Prioritizes critical data synchronization
    - Runs in background without blocking UI
  - **State Changes**:
    - Similar to manual sync
    - Notification of completed sync

### System-Triggered Actions

#### 1. Connection State Management
- **Trigger**: Network status change
- **Process**:
  - Service worker detects connection state change
  - Appropriate mode activated (online/offline)
  - UI updated to reflect current state
  - For offline → online: Sync process initiated
  - For online → offline: Critical data prefetching may occur

#### 2. Intelligent Data Caching
- **Trigger**: User navigation and data access patterns
- **Process**:
  - Edge analyzes usage patterns
  - Predicts likely needed data
  - Strategically caches data through service worker
  - Prioritizes high-value, frequently accessed data
  - Respects device storage limitations

#### 3. Cache Invalidation
- **Trigger**: Data updates on server
- **Process**:
  - Edge detects relevant data changes
  - Sends cache invalidation signal to online clients
  - Clients refresh affected data
  - Ensures data consistency across devices

#### 4. Session Expiration Handling
- **Trigger**: Session timeout or invalidation
- **Process**:
  - Edge detects invalid session
  - Initiates re-authentication flow
  - Preserves unsaved changes if possible
  - Provides clear user notification
