### 249) How do we balance transparency about incidents vs. protecting the company?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Incident communication (A.16.1.4):** stakeholder notifications.  
- **Breach notification principles (Rec.85):** proportionate disclosure.

**Plain-English answer**  
Apply a **Risk-Based Disclosure** approach: share facts that are material to stakeholders (regulators, customers) but withhold tactical details (e.g., specific vulnerabilities) that could aid attackers. Use a decision tree to guide who sees what and when.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.16.1.4; GDPR Recital 85

**Why it matters**  
Maintains trust without jeopardizing security or legal standing.
