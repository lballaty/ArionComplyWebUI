### 239) What if we need to shut down systems or services for compliance reasons?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Operational controls (Cl.8.1):** implement and manage processes.

**Plain-English answer**  
Follow a **Shutdown Playbook**: notify users, preserve logs, switch to fallback services, and document start/stop times in the **Shutdown Log**. Then run forensic checks or apply urgent patches before restart.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 8.1

**Why it matters**  
Ensures controlled shutdowns limit data loss and service disruption.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Invoke **Service Shutdown** workflow.  
- Update **Shutdown Log** with timestamps and actions.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Guides notification, shutdown, and restart steps.  
- **[Report]** Tracks downtime and recovery metrics.

**Likely follow-ups**
