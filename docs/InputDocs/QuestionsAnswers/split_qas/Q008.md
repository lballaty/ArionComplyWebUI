### 8) What’s the difference between being “compliant” and being “certified”?

**Standard terms)**
- **Certified:** an accredited CB has audited you against a **standard** (e.g., ISO 27001) and issued a certificate.
- **Compliant:** you meet legal or policy requirements (e.g., GDPR), with or without certification.
- **GDPR schemes (Arts 42–43):** voluntary certification frameworks, not legal safe harbors.

**Plain-English answer**
“Certified” means a third party has **audited** you against a standard and granted a certificate. “Compliant” means you **meet** legal or contractual requirements, which can include standards but don’t depend on a certificate. Laws like GDPR don’t have universal CB certification; some schemes exist but don’t replace legal duties.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1 Clause 5; GDPR Articles 42–43
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls

**Why it matters**
Customers often ask for **certification** to standards; regulators look for **compliance** with laws.

**Do next in our platform**
- Review your **certification roadmap** separately from your **legal compliance** plan.
- Track **certification milestones** and **legal duties** in different registers.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Dual-track compliance vs certification.
- **[Workflow]** Parallel roadmaps.
- **[Report]** Export cert status vs legal status summaries.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Are GDPR certification schemes worth it?” (They can help assurance but don’t replace legal compliance.)
