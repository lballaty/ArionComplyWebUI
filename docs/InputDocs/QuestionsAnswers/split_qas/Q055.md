### 55) What's the minimum viable compliance program we can implement fast?

**Standard terms**  
- **Scope (ISO 27001 Cl. 4.3):** restrict ISMS boundaries.  
- **Accountability (GDPR Art. 24):** apply basic measures from day one.  
- **PIMS Context (ISO 27701 Cl. 4.1):** privacy extension minimal scope.

**Plain-English answer**  
An MVP program includes: defined scope, initial RoPA, core policies (access, incident), MFA, backups, and a 30-min awareness session. You can stand this up in **2–4 weeks** for small teams.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3; GDPR Article 24  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 4.1

**Why it matters**
