## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of email security like protecting diplomatic correspondence during wartime - every message is a potential intelligence target.** Just as diplomatic pouches use multiple layers of protection (sealed containers, armed escorts, encrypted contents, authentication seals, and chain of custody protocols), organizational email requires comprehensive protection against interception, tampering, impersonation, and content analysis by hostile actors. A single compromised email can expose trade secrets, enable social engineering attacks, or provide entry points for sophisticated cyber operations.

Email Security provides **comprehensive communication protection** for the digital equivalent of all organizational correspondence, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of business communications across all threat environments.

---

## 2. Procedure Overview

This Email Security Procedure establishes systematic controls for protecting organizational email communications from unauthorized access, interception, modification, and misuse.
