### 5) What is the EU AI Act and when do we need to comply?

**Standard terms)**
- **High-risk AI (EU AI Act Annex III):** categories of AI (e.g., biometric, critical infrastructure) subject to strict rules.
- **Obligations (EU AI Act Art. 6):** requirements for governance, data quality, transparency, and human oversight.

**Plain-English answer**
The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk. **High-risk** systems must meet governance, quality, transparency, and oversight rules starting at different dates (e.g., 24 months post-entry into force). Lower-risk systems have lighter duties (transparency disclosures). Check when your category’s deadlines begin **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** EU AI Act 2024 Article 6; Annex III
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** GDPR Article 22; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.18

**Why it matters**
Missing deadlines can lead to fines and a halt on putting AI into service.

**Do next in our platform**
- Classify each AI system by risk category.
- Map obligations (Art. 6) to controls and policies.
- Schedule compliance milestones by risk-category timeline.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Classify-Assist]** AI risk-category wizard.
- **[Register]** AI inventory with risk tags.
- **[Tracker]** Obligations and deadlines.
