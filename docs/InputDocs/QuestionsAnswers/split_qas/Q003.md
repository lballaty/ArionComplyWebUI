### 3) Is GDPR just a European thing or does it affect my US/non-EU company too?

**Standard terms)**
- **Territorial scope (GDPR Article 3):** applies to non-EU companies offering goods/services to, or monitoring, EU individuals.
- **Offering goods/services:** targeting EU market (e.g., pricing, localized marketing).
- **Monitoring behavior:** tracking EU individuals’ activities (e.g., analytics, profiling).

**Plain-English answer**
GDPR applies to non-EU companies when they **offer goods or services** to EU individuals or **monitor** their behavior. Just having a publicly accessible website **is not enough**, but actively marketing to or tracking EU visitors **triggers** GDPR duties **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Article 3
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** CPRA Section 1798.140

**Why it matters**
Misunderstanding scope leads to unexpected obligations or wasted effort on out-of-scope scenarios.

**Do next in our platform**
- Run the **Territorial Scope** wizard.
- If in-scope, build your **RoPA** and tag processing activities.
- Map data subjects and purposes to confirm coverage.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Workflow]** Guided scope decision tree.
- **[Register]** Data processing map with in/out flags.
- **[Classify-Assist]** Auto-tag high-risk activities.
- **[Dashboard]** Live scope status report.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What if we only have EU employees but no customers?” (Still in-scope for employee data)
- “Do we need an EU representative?” (Art. 27—if no EU establishment **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**)
