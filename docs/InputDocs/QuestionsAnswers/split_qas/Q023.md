### 23) What happens if we fail an ISO 27001 audit – do we get in legal trouble?

**Standard terms)**
- **Internal audit (ISO 27001 Cl. 9.2):** identifies non-conformities.
- **Corrective action (Cl. 10.2):** process to address non-conformities.

**Plain-English answer**
Failing an ISO audit isn’t a crime; it means non-conformities that must be fixed per the CB’s schedule. The certification body can delay or withdraw your certificate, impacting customer contracts, but there’s no direct legal penalty from ISO itself.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clauses 9.2; 10.2

**Why it matters**
Timely CAPs keep your certification valid and protect business reputation.

**Do next in our platform**
- Record all **non-conformities**.

- Track closure deadlines.

**How our platform will help**
