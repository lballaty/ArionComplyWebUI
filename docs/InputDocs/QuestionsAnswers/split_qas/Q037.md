### 37) Are there different costs for small companies vs. large enterprises?

**Standard terms)**
- **Scope (ISO 27001 Cl. 4.3):** larger scopes incur more control implementation and audit days.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes—small scopes (few assets, controls) cost 50–75 % less than enterprise scopes. Audit days scale with number of locations and processes. Consultancy and tooling costs similarly scale by project complexity.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.3

**Why it matters**
Accurately estimating per size avoids under-budgeting or overpaying.

**Do next in our platform**
- Use the **Cost Estimator** by headcount and asset count.
- Compare scenarios for minimal vs full scope.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Report]** Size-vs-cost simulations.
- **[Dashboard]** Cost-scaling view.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “How do we justify costs to leadership?” (Use ROI model—see Q048)
