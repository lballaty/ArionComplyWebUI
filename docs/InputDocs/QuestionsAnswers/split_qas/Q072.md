### 72) Should we focus on one standard/regulation at a time or tackle them all together?

**Standard terms**  
- **Integration (ISO 27001 Cl. 4.4):** align ISMS with other management systems.  
- **Principles (GDPR Art. 5):** core concepts that overlap with many frameworks.  
- **PIMS context (ISO 27701 Cl. 4.2):** integrates privacy into ISMS.

**Plain-English answer**  
An integrated approach leverages shared controls (e.g., risk management, access control) across ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, and AI Act—saving time. Our platform auto-maps overlaps so you build once, comply broadly.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.4; GDPR Article 5  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 4.2

**Why it matters**  
Avoids duplicated work and inconsistent policies.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Run **Multi-Standard Strategy** workflow.  
- Review control overlap matrix.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Unified control library.  
- **[Planner]** Cross-standard project plan.  
- **[Dashboard]** Compliance coverage map.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “Which controls cover all frameworks?” (Check overlap report)
