### 172) What's the EU AI Act and does it affect companies outside Europe?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **EU AI Act (Art. 2):** European regulation setting rules for the development, placement on the market, and use of AI systems.  
- **Territorial scope (GDPR Art. 3):** applies to organizations outside the EU if they target EU individuals or markets.

**Plain-English answer**  
The EU AI Act is a comprehensive framework regulating AI systems based on risk categories, from prohibited to minimal-risk. It applies not only to companies in the EU but also to those outside Europe if they place AI systems on the EU market or their systems are used in the EU. Similar to GDPR, this extraterritorial scope means non-EU providers serving EU customers must meet the Act’s requirements.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** EU AI Act Article 2  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** GDPR Article 3

**Why it matters**  
Even if your company is not based in Europe, you may still need to comply to access EU markets or work with EU partners.
