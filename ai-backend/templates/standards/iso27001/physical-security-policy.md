## 1. Foundation Understanding

**Think of physical security like protecting a high-security government facility or central bank vault.** Just as Fort Knox employs multiple concentric security zones (public roads, outer perimeter, guard stations, vault areas), sophisticated access controls (biometrics, multi-factor authentication, escort requirements), environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, motion detection), and 24/7 surveillance systems, organizations must implement layered physical security to protect their critical information assets and infrastructure. A document stored in a secure vault requires different protections than materials in a general office area, yet both must be appropriately secured based on their sensitivity and value.

Physical security provides the **foundational protection layer** for all other security controls - the most sophisticated cybersecurity measures are useless if an attacker can simply walk into your data center and steal servers.

## 2. Policy Statement

This policy establishes multi-layered security zones, access controls, environmental protections, and monitoring systems to ensure the physical security of critical business operations and information assets.
