## **1. Procedure Foundation**

### **1.1 Understanding Incident Management**

Think of incident management like operating an emergency response center for a major city. Just as emergency services need clear procedures for receiving 911 calls, dispatching appropriate responders, coordinating multi-agency responses, and conducting post-incident analysis - security incident management requires structured processes to detect, respond to, and learn from security events.

**Real-World Analogy**: Consider how a hospital emergency department operates:
- **Triage**: Quickly assess incoming patients and prioritize based on severity
- **Immediate Response**: Deploy appropriate medical teams and resources
- **Coordination**: Coordinate with specialists, labs, and other departments
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records for medical and legal purposes
- **Communication**: Keep families informed while protecting patient privacy
- **Continuous Improvement**: Analyze cases to improve emergency response procedures

Security incident management follows similar principles - rapid assessment, appropriate response, coordinated effort, thorough documentation, stakeholder communication, and continuous improvement.

### **1.2 Procedure Purpose**

This procedure establishes detailed operational steps to:
- **Detect and Report**: Identify and report security events and incidents
- **Assess and Classify**: Evaluate and classify security incidents by severity
- **Respond and Contain**: Execute appropriate response and containment actions
- **Investigate and Analyze**: Conduct thorough incident investigation and analysis
- **Communicate and Coordinate**: Manage stakeholder communication and coordination
- **Recover and Restore**: Restore normal operations and implement improvements
- **Learn and Improve**: Capture lessons learned and improve incident response

### **1.3 Procedure Scope**

This procedure applies to:
- **All Security Events**: Any observable occurrence that may impact security
- **All Security Incidents**: Confirmed security events requiring response action
- **All Personnel**: Employees, contractors, and third parties involved in incident response
- **All Systems**: Information systems, networks, applications, and infrastructure
- **All Locations**: On-premises, cloud, remote, and third-party environments
