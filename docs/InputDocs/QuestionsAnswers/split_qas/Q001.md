### 1) What is ISO 27001 and why does everyone keep talking about it?

**Standard terms)**
- **ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 4.1):** a structured system of policies, processes, controls, and roles to manage information-security risks.
- **Annex A controls (ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.5):** specific security measures (e.g., access control, asset management).

**Plain-English answer**
ISO 27001 is the global benchmark for building an **Information Security Management System** (ISMS). It guides you through defining your security scope, assessing risks, selecting controls, assigning responsibilities, and continuously improving. Many customers and partners ask for ISO 27001 certification because it’s an **auditable, recognized proof** of your security maturity.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 4.1; Annex A.5
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Section 1.1; ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5.1

**Why it matters**
Certification provides a **single source of truth**—customers trust your security without needing their own audit.

**Do next in our platform**
- Define your **ISMS scope** using the Context Wizard.
- Populate the **risk register** and link risks to controls.
- Generate your **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** baseline.
- Upload existing policies and assign control owners.

**How our platform will help**
- **[NL-Portal]** Navigate directly to ISMS setup screens.
- **[Register]** Pre-structured risk and asset registers with ISO mappings.
- **[Draft Doc]** Auto-generate policies and SoA from templates.
- **[Workflow]** Guided ISMS implementation with task assignments.
- **[Dashboard]** Track implementation progress and control coverage.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “What exactly is an ISMS?” (See Q010.)
- “Which controls are in Annex A?” (See Q025.)
- “How long and how much does certification cost?” (See Q051.)
