## **1. Policy Foundation**

### **1.1 Understanding Physical and Environmental Security**

Think of physical and environmental security like protecting a medieval castle. Just as a castle has multiple layers of defense - outer walls, gates, inner courtyards, and the keep - modern physical security requires multiple layers of protection to safeguard information assets and the people who work with them.

**Real-World Analogy**: Consider a modern bank's security approach:
- **Perimeter Security**: Like the outer fence and lighting around the bank building
- **Access Control**: Like the security doors and guards that control who enters
- **Area Protection**: Like the vault with its specialized access controls and monitoring
- **Environmental Protection**: Like fire suppression systems and climate control that protect both people and assets
- **Equipment Security**: Like the specialized secure transport for ATMs and cash handling equipment

### **1.2 Policy Purpose**

This policy establishes a comprehensive framework to:
- **Protect Personnel**: Ensure the safety and security of all personnel
- **Safeguard Assets**: Protect information systems, equipment, and facilities
- **Prevent Unauthorized Access**: Control physical access to sensitive areas and systems
- **Mitigate Environmental Threats**: Protect against environmental hazards and disruptions
- **Ensure Business Continuity**: Maintain operations through physical security measures

### **1.3 Policy Scope**

- **All Facilities**: Offices, data centers, warehouses, and remote locations
- **All Personnel**: Employees, contractors, visitors, and service providers
- **All Assets**: Information systems, equipment, documents, and infrastructure
- **All Areas**: Public areas, work areas, secure areas, and restricted areas
