### 127) Do we need special contracts with vendors who handle our data?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **Supplier relationships (ISO 27001 A.5.19):** agreements must define security requirements.  
- **Processor contracts (GDPR Art. 28):** mandatory clauses for vendors processing personal data.  
- **PII processor agreements (ISO 27701 Cl. 7.2.7):** privacy-specific contractual terms.

**Plain-English answer**  
Yes — if a vendor processes your data, especially personal data, you need a written agreement that sets out security, confidentiality, and compliance obligations. Under GDPR, processor contracts must include specific terms (e.g., processing only on documented instructions, confidentiality, security measures, subprocessor controls). ISO 27001 also requires that supplier agreements address information security risks.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.5.19; GDPR Article 28  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 7.2.7

**Why it matters**  
Clear, compliant contracts reduce legal and security risks from third parties.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Check the **Vendor Register** for all suppliers handling data.  
- For each vendor, create or update a **Data Processing Agreement** (DPA) using templates.  
- Ensure agreements cover both security and privacy obligations.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Register]** Maintain an up-to-date vendor list with contract status.  
- **[Workflow]** Guided DPA creation and approval process.  
- **[Draft Doc]** Pre-approved DPA templates with GDPR-compliant clauses.

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “Do we need DPAs with all vendors?” (Only those processing personal data, but ISO 27001 covers all suppliers handling sensitive information) [LOCAL LAW CHECK]
