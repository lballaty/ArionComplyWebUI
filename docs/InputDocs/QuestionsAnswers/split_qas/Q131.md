### 131) What's the difference between internal audits, external audits, and regulatory investigations?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **Internal audit (ISO 27001 Cl. 9.2):** self-assessment against your own ISMS and standard requirements.  
- **External audit:** performed by an independent certification body or customer for assurance purposes.  
- **Regulatory investigation (GDPR Art. 58):** formal review by a supervisory authority with legal powers.

**Plain-English answer**  
An **internal audit** is planned and run by your organization (or an internal team) to verify compliance and readiness, often before an external audit. An **external audit** is conducted by an accredited certification body or a customer’s auditor to validate compliance and issue certificates or assurance reports. A **regulatory investigation** is initiated by a government or regulatory body, often due to complaints, incidents, or risk assessments, and can compel disclosure or impose penalties.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 9.2; GDPR Article 58  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 9.2
