### 42) Will compliance requirements slow down our product development?

**Standard terms)**  
- **Risk planning (ISO 27001 Cl. 6.1):** integrate risk treatment in planning.  
- **PIMS planning (ISO 27701 Cl. 6.1):** privacy risk planning.

**Plain-English answer**  
If treated as an afterthought, yes—but embedding security/privacy into agile sprints adds just 5–10 % overhead. Early threat modeling and automated checks prevent major rework.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 6.1  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 6.1

**Why it matters**  
Proactive integration avoids costly delays and technical debt.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Launch **Dev Integration** workflow.  
- Map security tasks to sprints.

**How our platform will help**  
- **[Workflow]** Dev/sprint task assignments.  
- **[Planner]** Sprint compliance planner.  

**Likely follow-ups**  
- “What automated tools can help?” (Static analysis, IaC scanners)
