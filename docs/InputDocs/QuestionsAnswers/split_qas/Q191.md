### 191) What qualifications or training should we look for in compliance consultants?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **Competence (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.2):** ensuring personnel have the necessary knowledge and skills for their role.  
- **Competence (ISO 27701 Cl. 7.2):** privacy-specific competence requirements.  
- **DPO tasks (GDPR Art. 39):** includes advising, monitoring compliance, and training.

**Plain-English answer**  
Seek consultants with certifications like **ISO 27001 Lead Implementer/Auditor**, **CIPP/E** for privacy, or **CISM/CISSP** for security. Industry-specific experience, a track record in similar compliance projects, and knowledge of relevant regulations (GDPR, NIS2, AI Act) are also important. Good consultants can bridge policy, technical, and operational perspectives.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.2; ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Clause 7.2  
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** GDPR Article 39
