### 19) We’re a subsidiary of a larger company — who’s responsible for compliance?

**Standard terms)**
- **Controller (GDPR Art. 4(7)):** entity determining purposes/means of processing.
- **Joint controllers (GDPR Art. 26):** share decisions and must have an arrangement.
- **Processor (GDPR Art. 28):** processes on another’s instructions.

**Plain-English answer**
Each legal entity is responsible for its own processing. If HQ decides purposes/means, they’re a **controller** (possibly joint). If the subsidiary acts on HQ’s instructions, it’s a **processor** unless you share control decisions.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 4(7), 26, 28
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27701:2019 Section 5

**Why it matters**
Misclassifying roles causes contract and audit issues.

**Do next in our platform**
- Map roles for each processing activity.
- Draft or update **joint-controller** arrangements or **DPAs**.
- Update your RoPA with correct roles.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Role-mapping register.
- **[Draft Doc]** Joint-controller and DPA templates.
- **[Approval]** E-sign agreements.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “Do we need a group data-sharing agreement?” (Often yes)
