**Standard terms)**
- **NIS2 enforcement (Art. 36):** Member States may suspend/revoke licenses for essential services.

Under NIS2, regulators in some countries can suspend or revoke operating licenses for critical service providers. GDPR gives authorities power to suspend data processing but not revoke business licenses. Check your local implementation **[LOCAL LAW CHECK]**.
