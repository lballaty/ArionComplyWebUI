## **1. Procedure Foundation**

### **1.1 Understanding Access Review and Certification**

Think of access review and certification like conducting a comprehensive security audit of a high-security facility. Just as a military base regularly reviews who has access to classified areas, validates their security clearances, ensures access cards are still needed, and promptly revokes access for personnel who have left or changed roles - access review and certification ensures that digital access rights remain appropriate, current, and secure across all organizational systems.

**Real-World Analogy**: Consider how a major hospital manages access to different areas:
- **Regular Audits**: Like quarterly reviews of who can access the pharmacy, surgical suites, and patient records
- **Role Validation**: Like verifying that only current cardiologists can access cardiac patient data
- **Access Certification**: Like department heads confirming that their staff members need their current access levels
- **Immediate Revocation**: Like instantly deactivating access for terminated employees or role changes
- **Exception Management**: Like managing temporary access for visiting specialists with proper approvals
- **Compliance Documentation**: Like maintaining detailed records for medical regulatory audits

Access review and certification provides ongoing assurance that access rights align with current business needs and security requirements.

### **1.2 Procedure Purpose**

This procedure establishes detailed operational steps to:
- **Validate Access Rights**: Systematically validate all user access rights and permissions
- **Ensure Appropriateness**: Confirm access rights align with current roles and responsibilities
- **Identify Excessive Access**: Detect and remediate excessive or inappropriate access
- **Maintain Compliance**: Meet regulatory and policy access review requirements
- **Support Certification**: Enable management certification of access appropriateness
- **Automate Reviews**: Leverage automation to improve review efficiency and accuracy
- **Track Remediation**: Monitor and track access remediation activities
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously improve access governance processes

### **1.3 Procedure Scope**

This procedure applies to:
- **All Access Types**: System access, application access, data access, and privileged access
- **All Users**: Employees, contractors, service accounts, and third-party users
- **All Systems**: On-premises systems, cloud services, and hybrid environments
- **All Environments**: Production, development, testing, and staging systems
- **All Access Levels**: Standard access, privileged access, and administrative access
