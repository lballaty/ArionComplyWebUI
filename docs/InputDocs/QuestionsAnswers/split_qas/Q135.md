### 135) Does using AI in our products trigger additional compliance requirements?

**Standard terms)**  
- **High-risk AI (EU AI Act Art. 5):** systems require strict obligations.  
- **Automated decisions (GDPR Art. 22):** special rights for data subjects.

**Plain-English answer**  
Yes—classify your AI systems by risk. High-risk uses (biometric ID, credit scoring) demand risk assessments, quality management, and transparency. Automated decision-making under GDPR also requires disclosure and opt-out rights.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** EU AI Act Article 5; GDPR Article 22

**Why it matters**  
Non-compliance can incur heavy fines and restrictions on AI deployment.

**Do next in our platform**  
- Populate **AI Compliance** register.  
- Run **AI Risk Classification** workflow.
