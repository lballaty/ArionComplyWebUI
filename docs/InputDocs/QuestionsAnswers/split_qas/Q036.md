### 36) What are the ongoing annual costs after we get certified?

**Standard terms)**
- **Audit program (ISO 17021-1 Cl. 7):** annual surveillance fees.
- **Continual improvement (ISO 27001 Cl. 10.3):** cycle of reviews and updates.

**Plain-English answer**
Expect annual surveillance audit fees (€3 k–€8 k), internal audit costs (~€5 k), training refresh (~€2 k), and tool-license renewals (~€1 k–€3 k). Total OPEX ~€10 k–€20 k depending on scope.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 Clause 7; ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 10.3

**Why it matters**
Budgeting OPEX ensures certification sustainability.
