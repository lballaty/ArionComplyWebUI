### 17) What if we just use cloud services like Office 365 and Salesforce — does compliance still apply?

**Standard terms)**
- **Controller vs Processor (GDPR Art. 28):** you remain controller; cloud provider is processor.
- **Security (GDPR Art. 32):** you must ensure appropriate measures.
- **Transfers (GDPR Art. 44):** apply if data moves outside the EU.

**Plain-English answer**
Yes—cloud providers don’t relieve your duties. You must choose providers with **sufficient guarantees**, sign a **DPA**, configure security controls, and manage data-transfer mechanisms as needed.

**Applies to**
- **Primary:** GDPR Articles 28, 32, 44
- **Also relevant/Overlaps:** ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.15

**Why it matters**
Assuming the cloud covers everything leads to compliance gaps.

**Do next in our platform**
- Add vendors to **RoPA** and **vendor register**.
- Execute and **approve** **DPAs**.
- Verify regions and sub-processors.

**How our platform will help**
- **[Register]** Vendor & transfer registers.
- **[Workflow]** DPA/agreement approval.
- **[Report]** Cloud compliance summary.

**Likely follow-ups**
- “How do we audit cloud providers remotely?” (See Q184)

**Sources**
- GDPR Articles 28, 32, 44
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.15
