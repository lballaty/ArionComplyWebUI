# Customer Administration Screens Workflow

## Screens: `adminPanel.html` and various customer administration screens

### Overview
The Customer Administration interfaces provide authorized customer administrators with tools to configure and manage their specific instance of the ArionComply platform. These screens are part of the customer-facing application but are only accessible to users with appropriate administrative permissions within each customer organization. Unlike the vendor administration screens (which manage the entire platform), customer administration screens focus solely on configuration and management specific to a single customer instance.

Customer administrators can manage users, roles, templates, and configurations within their organization's scope, but cannot access data or settings from other customers. All administration screens feature real-time updates when database changes are detected, ensuring administrators always see the current state of the system without manual refreshes.

### Customer Administration Architecture

#### 1. Customer Admin Panel Structure
The customer admin panel serves as the central hub for all customer-specific management functions:

- **Administration Dashboard**: Instance health, usage statistics, and alerts
- **User & Access Management**: Organization users, roles, and permissions
- **Content Management**: Organization-specific templates and content
- **Configuration**: Instance settings and preferences
- **Monitoring**: Activity logs and audit trails
- **Workflow Management**: Approval processes and workflow configurations

#### 2. Integration with Main Application
The customer administration screens are integrated with the main application:

- **Shared Codebase**: Part of the main customer application
