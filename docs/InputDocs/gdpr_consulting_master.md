## Section 6: Glossary of Terms and Concepts

*This glossary assumes no prior knowledge of data protection or technical concepts. Each term is explained in business context with practical implications.*

### **A**

**Adequate Decision**: A formal ruling by the European Commission that declares a non-EU country has data protection laws that are essentially equivalent to GDPR standards. Think of this as the EU's "stamp of approval" that makes it legal to send personal data to that country without additional paperwork or safeguards. Countries like the UK, Canada, and Japan have received adequacy decisions, while the US has not (requiring additional protections for data transfers).

**Anonymization**: The process of permanently removing or scrambling personal information so that it becomes impossible to identify who the data relates to, even with additional information or advanced technology. This is like shredding a document so thoroughly that it can never be reconstructed. Once data is properly anonymized, GDPR rules no longer apply because it's no longer considered "personal data." However, true anonymization is technically very difficult to achieve - many organizations think their data is anonymous when it can actually still be used to identify people.

### **B**

**Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)**: Internal company privacy policies that have been formally approved by European data protection authorities, allowing large multinational corporations to transfer personal data between their offices in different countries. Think of BCRs as a "global privacy passport" for big companies. Getting BCRs approved is a lengthy, expensive process that typically only makes sense for large organizations with complex international operations. Most smaller companies use Standard Contractual Clauses instead.

**Breach Notification**: The legal requirement under GDPR to report certain types of data security incidents to government regulators within 72 hours of discovering them. This is like having to call the police within 72 hours of discovering a break-in at your business. The organization must also notify affected individuals if the breach is likely to result in high risk to their rights and freedoms (such as identity theft or financial fraud). Failing to notify on time can result in fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide turnover.

**Breach Response Plan**: A detailed, written procedure that tells employees exactly what to do when personal data is accidentally disclosed, stolen, or accessed by unauthorized people. This is like having a fire evacuation plan - you hope you'll never need it, but when an incident happens, having clear steps prevents panic and ensures legal requirements are met. The plan should include who to contact, how to assess the severity, what to document, and when to notify authorities and affected individuals.

### **C**

**Consent**: Under GDPR, consent means that a person has clearly agreed to have their personal data processed for specific purposes. Real consent must be freely given (no coercion), specific (clearly explaining what you'll do with the data), informed (the person understands what they're agreeing to), and unambiguous (a clear positive action, not just silence or inactivity). Most importantly, people must be able to withdraw consent as easily as they gave it. Pre-ticked boxes, buried terms in lengthy documents, or making consent a condition of service generally don't meet GDPR standards.

**Controller**: The organization or person who decides why personal data is collected and how it will be used. Think of the controller as the "decision maker" - they set the purpose and determine the methods of processing. For example, if your company collects customer email addresses to send newsletters, your company is the controller. Controllers have the primary legal responsibility under GDPR and face the highest potential fines for non-compliance. Even if you hire another company to actually handle the data, you remain responsible as the controller.

**Cross-Border Processing**: Any handling of personal data that either spans multiple EU countries or involves sending data outside the EU entirely. This triggers additional GDPR requirements because different countries may have different levels of data protection. Companies must identify their "lead supervisory authority" (main regulator) and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international transfers. Even cloud storage or email services may involve cross-border processing if servers are located in different countries.

### **D**

**Data Minimization**: A core GDPR principle requiring organizations to collect and keep only the personal data that is actually necessary for their stated business purpose. This means you cannot collect data "just in case it might be useful later" or keep information indefinitely. For example, if you're selling shoes online, you need the customer's delivery address and payment information, but you probably don't need to know their age, marital status, or employer. Data minimization reduces privacy risks and limits your liability if a breach occurs.

**Data Portability**: The legal right for individuals to obtain a copy of their personal data in a structured, commonly used digital format and transfer it to another service provider. Think of this like being able to export your contacts from one phone to another, or download your photos from one social media platform to upload elsewhere. This right only applies to data that was processed based on consent or contract, and only when processing is carried out by automated means. Organizations must provide the data for free and within one month of the request.

**Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**: A legally binding contract between a data controller (the organization making decisions about personal data) and a data processor (a vendor or service provider handling that data on their behalf). The DPA specifies exactly what the processor can do with the data, how long they can keep it, what security measures they must implement, and what happens when the contract ends. Without a proper DPA, controllers can face significant fines. Every vendor relationship involving personal data (cloud services, payroll providers, marketing platforms) typically requires a DPA.

**Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**: A formal risk assessment document required when planned data processing activities are likely to pose high privacy risks to individuals. This includes activities like large-scale monitoring, processing sensitive data, or using new technologies like AI. The DPIA identifies potential privacy harms, evaluates whether the processing is necessary and proportionate, and describes measures to mitigate risks. Think of it as an environmental impact assessment, but for privacy. DPIAs must be completed before high-risk processing begins and may need to be shared with regulators.

**Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: A designated privacy expert who monitors GDPR compliance within an organization and serves as the main contact point with data protection authorities. DPOs are mandatory for public authorities and organizations whose core business involves large-scale monitoring or processing of sensitive personal data. The DPO must be independent, have expert knowledge of privacy law, and report directly to senior management. They cannot be penalized for performing their duties and must be given sufficient resources and authority to be effective.

**Data Subject**: The legal term for any living person whose personal data is being processed. This could be employees, customers, website visitors, job applicants, or anyone else whose information an organization holds. Data subjects have specific legal rights under GDPR, including the right to know what data is held about them, correct inaccuracies, request deletion, and object to certain uses of their information. Organizations must respect these rights regardless of whether the data subject is an EU resident, as long as GDPR applies to the processing.

**Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)**: A formal request from an individual asking to see what personal data an organization holds about them and how it's being used. Organizations must respond within one month, providing a copy of the personal data and detailed information about processing purposes, retention periods, data sources, and who the data has been shared with. DSARs must be handled free of charge unless they are clearly excessive or repetitive. This right helps individuals understand and control how their information is being used.

### **E**

**Encryption**: A security technology that scrambles data so it becomes unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the correct "key" to unlock it. Think of encryption like putting information in a safe - even if someone steals the safe, they can't access what's inside without the combination. Under GDPR, encryption is considered an "appropriate technical measure" for protecting personal data. If properly encrypted data is breached, it may not need to be reported to authorities because the information remains protected. However, encryption is only as strong as how the keys are managed and protected.

**Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: The legal right for individuals to request deletion of their personal data under specific circumstances. This isn't an absolute right - organizations can refuse if they have compelling legitimate grounds to keep the data (such as legal obligations, freedom of expression, or defending legal claims). Common scenarios where erasure applies include when consent is withdrawn, data is no longer needed for the original purpose, or it was unlawfully processed. Organizations must respond to erasure requests within one month and, if they've shared the data with others, take reasonable steps to inform those parties about the deletion request.

### **F**

**Freely Given Consent**: Consent that is obtained without any form of coercion, pressure, or negative consequences for refusing. Under GDPR, consent cannot be freely given if there's a clear imbalance of power (like employer-employee relationships), if refusing consent would result in denial of service, or if consent is bundled with acceptance of terms and conditions. For example, making newsletter signup mandatory to create an account would not be considered freely given consent. True consent requires a genuine choice where saying "no" is as easy and consequence-free as saying "yes."

### **G**

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: The comprehensive privacy law that came into effect across the European Union in May 2018, replacing older national data protection laws with a single, unified standard. GDPR applies to any organization that processes personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located. It grants individuals strong rights over their personal data and imposes heavy obligations on organizations, with fines up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover (whichever is higher). GDPR represents one of the world's strongest privacy regimes and has influenced privacy laws globally.

### **H**

**High-Risk Processing**: Data processing activities that pose significant potential for harm to individuals' privacy, rights, or freedoms. Examples include systematic monitoring of public areas (like extensive CCTV networks), processing sensitive data on a large scale, using artificial intelligence for automated decision-making, or processing vulnerable people's data. High-risk processing requires additional safeguards like conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment, potentially consulting with regulators before starting, and implementing enhanced security measures. The concept helps organizations focus their compliance efforts on activities that matter most for privacy protection.

### **I**

**Incident Response Runbook**: A detailed, step-by-step procedure manual that guides employees through exactly what to do when a data security incident occurs. This includes how to recognize different types of incidents, who to notify immediately, how to contain and investigate the problem, what information to document, and when to notify authorities or affected individuals. Having a well-designed runbook is crucial because data breaches often happen outside normal business hours when senior staff may not be available. The runbook ensures that any employee can take appropriate initial actions to minimize harm and meet legal notification deadlines.

**Individual Rights**: The eight fundamental rights that GDPR grants to every person whose personal data is being processed. These rights are: (1) to be informed about data processing, (2) access their personal data, (3) correct inaccurate information, (4) delete their data in certain circumstances, (5) restrict how their data is used, (6) receive their data in a portable format, (7) object to certain processing activities, and (8) not be subject to purely automated decision-making. Organizations must have procedures in place to handle requests for each of these rights, typically responding within one month and usually free of charge.

### **J**

**Joint Controllers**: Two or more organizations that together decide why and how personal data will be processed. Unlike a controller-processor relationship where one organization gives instructions to another, joint controllers share decision-making responsibility. For example, two companies organizing a joint marketing campaign would likely be joint controllers for the campaign data. Joint controllers must have a written arrangement between them defining their respective responsibilities and must provide clear information to individuals about how to exercise their rights with either organization.

### **L**

**Lawful Basis**: One of six legal justifications that organizations must have before they can process personal data under GDPR. These are: (1) consent from the individual, (2) necessary for performing a contract, (3) required by law, (4) necessary to protect someone's vital interests (life or death situations), (5) necessary for a public task or official authority, and (6) necessary for legitimate interests that override the individual's privacy rights. Organizations must identify their lawful basis before processing begins and cannot change it later without strong justification. Different lawful bases provide different individual rights - for example, consent-based processing allows easy withdrawal, while contract-based processing does not.

**Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA)**: The main data protection regulator responsible for overseeing an organization's GDPR compliance when that organization operates in multiple EU countries. The LSA is typically located where the organization has its main establishment in the EU (usually where key management decisions are made). Having a single LSA simplifies compliance by providing one primary point of contact with regulators, rather than having to deal with authorities in every country where the organization operates. The LSA coordinates with other relevant authorities when necessary but leads investigations and enforcement actions.

**Legitimate Interests**: A lawful basis for processing personal data where an organization can demonstrate that their business need for the data outweighs the individual's privacy rights and freedoms. This requires a three-part test: (1) the purpose must be legitimate (lawful and clearly articulated), (2) the processing must be necessary for that purpose (no less intrusive alternative exists), and (3) the benefits must outweigh the impact on individuals. Legitimate interests cannot be used for processing children's data for marketing purposes and individuals always retain the right to object to legitimate interests processing.

### **M**

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: A security system that requires users to provide two or more different types of proof before gaining access to systems containing personal data. The "factors" typically include something you know (like a password), something you have (like a phone or security token), and something you are (like a fingerprint). MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Under GDPR, implementing MFA for systems containing personal data is considered an appropriate technical measure and may be required for high-risk processing activities.

### **O**

**One-Stop-Shop Mechanism**: A GDPR provision designed to simplify regulatory oversight for organizations operating across multiple EU countries. Instead of dealing with data protection authorities in every country where they operate, organizations can primarily interact with their Lead Supervisory Authority. This reduces administrative burden and provides more consistent enforcement. However, the one-stop-shop only applies to cross-border processing - purely domestic issues are still handled by local authorities.

### **P**

**Personal Data**: Under GDPR, this means any information that can be used to identify a specific living person, either directly or indirectly. Direct identifiers include obvious things like names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Indirect identifiers include less obvious information like IP addresses, device IDs, location data, or even combinations of data that could identify someone (like "35-year-old male teacher living in a specific small town"). The definition is deliberately broad - if there's any reasonable possibility that information could identify someone, either on its own or combined with other data, it's likely considered personal data under GDPR.

**Personal Data Breach**: Any security incident involving personal data, whether accidental or intentional. This includes obvious cases like hackers stealing customer databases, but also everyday situations like sending an email to the wrong person, losing a laptop containing personal data, or accidentally publishing information that should be private. Not all personal data breaches require notification to authorities - only those that are likely to pose risks to individuals' rights and freedoms. However, organizations must document all breaches and assess their potential impact to determine if reporting is required.

**Processor**: An organization that handles personal data on behalf of and under the instructions of another organization (the controller). Processors act like service providers - they don't make decisions about why data is collected or how it's used, but they do the actual work of processing it. Examples include cloud hosting providers, payroll companies, email marketing platforms, or IT support firms. Processors have their own GDPR obligations, including implementing appropriate security measures, only processing data as instructed, and notifying controllers about data breaches. However, controllers remain primarily responsible for GDPR compliance.

**Profiling**: Using automated systems to analyze or predict aspects of a person's behavior, preferences, interests, reliability, or other characteristics. Examples include credit scoring, targeted advertising, fraud detection, or HR screening tools. Profiling often involves analyzing large amounts of data to make inferences about individuals. Under GDPR, people have the right to know when profiling is happening, understand the logic behind it, and object to purely automated decision-making that significantly affects them. Special protections apply when profiling is used for automated decision-making.

**Pseudonymization**: A security technique that replaces direct identifiers (like names or account numbers) with artificial identifiers or "pseudonyms" (like randomly generated codes). Unlike anonymization, pseudonymized data can still be linked back to specific individuals if you have access to the separate "key" that maps pseudonyms to real identities. GDPR encourages pseudonymization as a privacy protection measure because it reduces risks while preserving data utility. However, pseudonymized data is still considered personal data and remains subject to GDPR requirements.

### **R**

**Record of Processing Activities (RoPA)**: A comprehensive written inventory that documents all the ways an organization processes personal data. The RoPA must include details about the purposes of processing, categories of data and people involved, who data is shared with, where data is stored or transferred, how long it's kept, and what security measures protect it. Think of the RoPA as a detailed map of all personal data flowing through your organization. Most organizations subject to GDPR must maintain a RoPA and make it available to data protection authorities upon request. Creating and maintaining an accurate RoPA is often the first step in GDPR compliance.

**Rectification**: The legal right for individuals to correct or complete personal data that is inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date. Organizations must respond to rectification requests within one month and make corrections free of charge unless the request is clearly excessive. If corrected data has been shared with other organizations, reasonable efforts must be made to inform them about the updates. This right helps ensure that decisions affecting individuals are based on accurate information.

**Restriction of Processing**: A data subject right that allows individuals to limit how their personal data can be used while still allowing it to be stored. This is like putting data "on hold" - it can be kept but not actively processed. Restriction typically applies in situations where data accuracy is disputed, processing is unlawful but the individual doesn't want deletion, the data is no longer needed for the original purpose but is required for legal claims, or an objection to processing is under review. During restriction, data can only be processed with consent or for specific legal purposes.

### **S**

**Special Categories of Personal Data**: Particularly sensitive types of personal information that receive extra legal protection under GDPR because disclosure could cause significant harm or discrimination. These include data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data used for identification, health information, and data about sex life or sexual orientation. Processing special categories requires both a regular lawful basis and an additional condition, with stricter rules about consent, transparency, and security measures.

**Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**: Pre-approved contract templates created by the European Commission that provide legal protection when transferring personal data from the EU to countries without adequate data protection laws. SCCs work like a standardized legal framework - organizations can't modify the core clauses but can add additional commercial terms. Using SCCs is often simpler and less expensive than other transfer mechanisms like Binding Corporate Rules. However, organizations must assess whether SCCs alone provide adequate protection or if additional safeguards are needed.

**Sub-Processor**: A third-party organization that a data processor uses to help fulfill its obligations to a data controller. For example, if Company A hires Company B to provide cloud storage services (making B a processor), and Company B uses Company C for backup services, then Company C is a sub-processor. Controllers must be informed about sub-processors and have the opportunity to object to their use. Processors remain fully liable to controllers for their sub-processors' actions and must ensure sub-processors meet the same data protection standards.

**Supervisory Authority**: The government agency in each EU member state responsible for enforcing GDPR and protecting individuals' privacy rights. These authorities have extensive powers including conducting investigations, issuing fines, ordering organizations to change their practices, and handling complaints from individuals. In some countries there's one national authority, while others have separate authorities for different sectors or regions. Organizations must cooperate with supervisory authorities and may need to consult with them before starting high-risk processing activities.

### **T**

**Technical and Organizational Measures (TOMs)**: The combination of technology solutions and business processes that organizations implement to protect personal data and ensure GDPR compliance. Technical measures include things like encryption, access controls, firewalls, and backup systems. Organizational measures include staff training, data protection policies, incident response procedures, and vendor management processes. GDPR requires "appropriate" TOMs based on the risks involved - higher-risk processing requires stronger protections. TOMs must be regularly reviewed and updated as technology and threats evolve.

**Third Country**: Any country outside the European Economic Area (which includes all EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). Transferring personal data to third countries requires additional legal protections because these countries may not have privacy laws equivalent to GDPR. Organizations must use approved transfer mechanisms like adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses, or Binding Corporate Rules. Even routine business activities like using cloud services or email providers may involve third country transfers if servers are located outside the EEA.

**Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)**: A detailed analysis that organizations must conduct before transferring personal data to countries without adequate data protection laws. The TIA evaluates whether the planned transfer can provide essentially equivalent protection to GDPR standards, taking into account local laws, government surveillance powers, and practical safeguards. If equivalent protection cannot be ensured, the transfer cannot proceed. TIAs must be documented and regularly reviewed, especially when local conditions change.

### **V**

**Vendor Risk Assessment**: A systematic evaluation of third-party suppliers' data protection and security practices before and during business relationships. This process examines the vendor's policies, technical measures, staff training, incident history, and compliance certifications to determine if they can adequately protect personal data. Vendor assessments should be proportionate to the risks involved - a company handling large volumes of sensitive data requires more scrutiny than one providing basic services. Regular reassessments ensure vendors maintain appropriate standards throughout the relationship.

### **Data Processing Context Terms**

**Automated Decision-Making**: Using computer systems or artificial intelligence to make decisions that significantly affect individuals without meaningful human involvement. Examples include automated loan approvals, employment screening algorithms, or fraud detection systems that automatically block transactions. GDPR provides special protections against purely automated decision-making, including the right to obtain human intervention, express one's point of view, and contest the decision. Organizations using automated decision-making must implement appropriate safeguards and provide clear information about the logic involved.

**Consent Management Platform (CMP)**: A technology solution that helps organizations collect, store, and manage user consent for various data processing activities, particularly for website cookies and marketing communications. A good CMP provides clear consent requests, allows granular choices (users can consent to some activities but not others), maintains detailed records of consent decisions, and makes it easy for users to change or withdraw consent later. CMPs are especially important for websites that need to comply with both GDPR and e-Privacy regulations.

**Data Mapping**: The systematic process of identifying and documenting how personal data flows through an organization's systems, processes, and relationships. Data mapping involves discovering where personal data is collected, how it moves between systems, who has access to it, how long it's kept, and where it ultimately goes (including deletion or archiving). This process is essential for creating a Record of Processing Activities, responding to individual rights requests, and understanding compliance obligations. Many organizations are surprised by how extensively personal data is embedded in their operations.

**Privacy by Design**: An approach to system and process design that builds privacy protection into technology and business practices from the very beginning, rather than trying to add it later as an afterthought. Privacy by design involves proactive rather than reactive measures, making privacy the default setting, embedding privacy into design specifications, ensuring full functionality with strong privacy protection, maintaining end-to-end security, ensuring visibility and transparency, and respecting user privacy. This approach is explicitly required by GDPR and helps prevent privacy problems before they occur.

**Privacy Notice**: A document that informs individuals about how their personal data will be collected, used, shared, and protected. Privacy notices must be provided when data is collected and should be easily accessible, written in clear language, and regularly updated. They must include specific information such as the organization's identity, purposes of processing, legal basis, data recipients, retention periods, individual rights, and contact information for questions or complaints. Unlike terms of service, privacy notices are primarily informational and don't require active acceptance.

**Purpose Limitation**: A fundamental GDPR principle requiring that personal data be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not processed in ways that are incompatible with those original purposes. This means organizations must clearly define why they're collecting data before they start, and they cannot later use it for completely different purposes without additional legal basis and transparency. For example, data collected for customer service cannot automatically be used for marketing without appropriate legal basis and notice to individuals.

**Retention Schedule**: A detailed policy document that specifies how long different types of personal data will be kept by an organization and what will happen to it afterward (deletion, anonymization, or archiving). Retention periods should be based on business necessity, legal requirements, and the purposes for which data was collected. Having a clear retention schedule helps organizations comply with the GDPR principle of storage limitation and ensures they can respond appropriately to deletion requests. Retention schedules should be regularly reviewed and updated as business needs change.

**Right to Object**: The legal right for individuals to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, particularly for direct marketing, profiling for marketing purposes, or processing based on legitimate interests. When someone objects to direct marketing, organizations must stop processing their data for those purposes immediately. For other objections, organizations can continue processing only if they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override the individual's interests, rights and freedoms. The right to object helps give individuals control over how their data is used.

**Sensitive Personal Data**: See Special Categories of Personal Data above. This term is sometimes used informally to refer to any personal data that could cause harm if disclosed, but legally under GDPR it specifically refers to the special categories that receive enhanced protection.
