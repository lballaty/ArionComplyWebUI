### 198) Are there free resources or do we need to pay for good compliance information?

**Standard term(s)**  
- **Communication (ISO 27001 Cl. 7.4):** managing internal and external information relevant to the ISMS.  
- **Supervisory authority tasks (GDPR Art. 57):** includes promoting public awareness and availability of resources.

**Plain-English answer**  
You’ll find free resources like **official regulations and standards summaries** (ISO abstracts, GDPR text from EUR-Lex), regulator guidance, community forums, and open-source templates. Paid options — including premium guides, consultant-authored playbooks, and subscription compliance tools — offer deeper analysis, turnkey templates, and regular updates. The right mix depends on your team’s expertise and how current you need the information to be.

**Applies to**  
- **Primary:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 7.4; GDPR Article 57
